Name your file `component-name.yml`, where _component-name_ is the name of\n   your component.\n4. Copy and paste the following template into the `Edit new file` section of the\n   page and fill out the correct information for your component.\n\n   ```\n   name: component name\n   website_url: >-\n     url of documentation / guidance page (if any)\n   code_url: >-\n     url of component code on GitHub\n   maintainer: name of maintainer team\n   description: >-\n     short description of purpose and usage of component\n   framework: choose one of Vanilla | Angular | React | Vue\n   design_asset: choose one of Sketch | Axure | Adobe XD | Figma\n   platform: Web\n   aliases:\n     - fuzzy term for component (e.g. an alias for a \"card\" component might be \"tile\")\n   date_added: YYY-MM-DDT00:00:00.000Z\n   ```\n\n5.
