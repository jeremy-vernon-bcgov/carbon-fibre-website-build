See Carbon Chatbot Add-on\nDesign Kit for the appropriate variants.\n\n![Launching a bot](images/chatbot-5.png)\n\n## Multiple threads (Experimental)\n\nWhen a bot cannot complete a request, the bot detects frustration, or the user\nwould simply prefer interacting with a person, it becomes necessary to connect\nthe user to a human agent.\n\n### User initiates change\n\nSometimes, a user indicates that they would like to chat with a human. Other\ntimes, this process can be suggested if a bot is repeatedly unsuccessful in\nanswering a user’s question.\n\n![User initiates change](images/chatbot-12.png)\n\n### Notify the user\n\nUse a toast notification bar to indicate when the user is in a new conversation\ncontext, or that a new user has joined the the chat. Call out any significant\nchanges with in-conversation status messages.\n\n![Notify the user](images/chatbot-13.png)\n\n### Multiple users\n\nCombining two or more human agents into the same thread is a common practice.\nWhere necessary, call out significant changes in who the user is addressing\n(particularly if they have different purposes).\n\n![Multiple users](images/chatbot-14.png)\n\n### Incoming messages\n\nFor new messages appearing in another thread, be sure to use dots above the\nThreads icon to alert the user of new messages. Then, within the menu, indicate\nthe amount of new messages on the specific thread. Visually distinguish threads\nwith new messages.\n\n![Incoming messages](images/chatbot-15.png)\n\n## Expanding cards (Experimental)\n\nWhere needed, use expanding cards to progressively disclose content. Use a full\npage view to show a very large amount of content to the user.\n\n### Default state\n\nCall out critical information in the default state. Provide a trigger to expand\nthe card.\n\n![Default state](images/chatbot-16.png)\n\n### Expanded state\n\nProvide more detailed information in the expanded state. Only if absolutely\nnecessary, provide a way to access the full view of the content.\n\n![Expanded state](images/chatbot-17.png)\n\n### Full view\n\nThe full view is a generic container that can be used to display long-form\ncontent that would otherwise crowd a conversation thread.\n\n![Full view](images/chatbot-18.png)\n\n## Error states (Experimental)\n\nBe sure to indicate to a user when their message has not been sent due to a\nconnectivity or server problem. When in a connected state, temporarily show the\nsuccess notification, and then remove it along with any message error\nindicators.\n\n![Chatbot error notification](images/chatbot-6.png)\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"5ab6bc4c078c5fda52c05a98627ebc54","counter":4425,"owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Chatbots","description":"Use a chatbot when a user would benefit from requesting information on-demand with natural language.
