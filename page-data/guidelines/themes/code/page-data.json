By default, `@carbon/themes` provides a set of color tokens that\nare pre-defined for a specific theme. Currently, we offer the following color\nthemes: white, gray 10, gray 90, gray 100 .\n\nYou can preview all of the token values for this on the\n[Carbon Design System website](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/color/usage)\n.\n\n### Sass\n\nIf you're project is using Sass, you can include this package and the\ncorresponding default theme by writing the following in your Sass file:\n\n```scss\n@import '@carbon/themes/scss/themes';\n```\n\nBy default, the white theme will be initialized. If you would like to include\nanother theme, you can do so by calling our mixin. For example:\n\n```scss\n@import '@carbon/themes/scss/themes';\n\n// Use the gray 10 theme\n@include carbon--theme($carbon--theme--g10);\n\n// Use the gray 90 theme\n@include carbon--theme($carbon--theme--g90);\n\n// Use the gray 100 theme\n@include carbon--theme($carbon--theme--g100);\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can set the global theme variable then call the mixin without\npassing in a theme name.\n\n```scss\n@import '@carbon/themes/scss/themes';\n\n$carbon--theme: $carbon--theme--g10;\n\n// Use the gray 10 theme\n@include carbon--theme();\n```\n\nInline theming can be done by using the mixin. For example:\n\n```scss\n@import '@carbon/themes/scss/themes';\n\n// Use the default white theme here\n\n.my-dark-theme {\n  @include carbon--theme($carbon--theme--g90) {\n    // Use the dark theme here\n  }\n}\n\n.my-darker-theme {\n  @include carbon--theme($carbon--theme--g100) {\n    // Use the darker theme here\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### JavaScript\n\nIf you're looking to use these themes in JavaScript, we export a variety of\nbindings for you to use, including:\n\n```js\nimport {\n  // An object of all themes\n  themes,\n\n  // Direct theme values\n  white,\n  g10,\n  g90,\n  g100,\n\n  // Specific token values\n  interactive01,\n  interactive02,\n} from '@carbon/themes';\n```\n\n## Resources\n\n<Row className=\"resource-card-group\">\n  <Column colMd={4} colLg={4} noGutterSm>\n    <ResourceCard\n      subTitle=\"Carbon theme package\"\n      href=\"https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/blob/master/packages/themes\"\n    >\n\n<MdxIcon name=\"bee\" />\n\n  </ResourceCard>\n  </Column>\n  <Column colMd={4} colLg={4} noGutterSm>\n    <ResourceCard\n      subTitle=\"Themes package demo\"\n      href=\"https://carbon-elements.netlify.app/themes/examples/preview/\"\n    >\n\n<MdxIcon name=\"bee\" />\n\n  </ResourceCard>\n  </Column>\n</Row>\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"256f035b4f085ed7fd45fd207a75891b","counter":1647,"owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Themes","label":"Themes are used to customize component styles to fit the specific aesthetic of a brand or product.","description":"Themes are used to customize component styles to fit the specific aesthetic of a brand or product.","tabs":["Overview","Code"]},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\nlabel:\n  Themes are used to customize component styles to fit the specific aesthetic of\n  a brand or product.\ntitle: Themes\ndescription:\n  Themes are used to customize component styles to fit the specific aesthetic of\n  a brand or product.\ntabs: ['Overview', 'Code']\n---\n\n<PageDescription>\n\nUse the themes package to customize your product while maintaining consistency.\n\n</PageDescription>\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\nIf you’re using carbon-components there’s no reason to install the themes\npackage separately.
