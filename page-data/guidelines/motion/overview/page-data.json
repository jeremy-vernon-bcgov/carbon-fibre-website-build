However, the motion design of the overarching UI — that is,\nhow the components interact with each other and enter and exit the page itself —\nis up to each product team to implement. Use this guidance to customize,\ncombine, coordinate, and choreograph this aspect of motion in the UI.\n\n## Style\n\nCarbon recognizes different types of moments in users' experience and offers two\nstyles of motion—_productive_ motion, and _expressive_ motion. The motion curves\nare designed to reflect the duality of man and machine.\n\nProductivity and expression are both essential to an interface. Reserve\nexpressive motion for occasional, important moments, to better capture the\nuser’s attention and offer a rhythmic break to the productive experience.\n\n<Tabs>\n<Tab label=\"Curves\">\n<Row>\n<Column colSm={6} colMd={4} colLg={6}>\n<p className=\"tab--columns_label\"> Productive </p>\n\n![Curve graphs representing differences between productive and expressive animation curves](images/Motion_overview_Curves_productive.svg)\n\n</Column>\n<Column colSm={6} colMd={4} colLg={6}>\n<p className=\"tab--columns_label\">Expressive</p>\n\n![Curve graphs representing differences between productive and expressive animation curves](images/Motion_overview_Curves_expressive.svg)\n\n</Column>\n\n</Row>\n\n</Tab>\n\n<Tab label=\"Abstract\">\n\n<Video vimeoId=\"310583009\" />\n\n</Tab>\n\n<Tab label=\"In-situ\">\n\n<Video vimeoId=\"310583036\" />\n\n</Tab>\n\n</Tabs>\n\n### Productive motion\n\nProductive motion creates a sense of efficiency and responsiveness, while remain\nsubtle and out of the way. Productive motion is appropriate for moments when the\nuser needs to focus on completing tasks. Microinteractions in Carbon such as\nbutton states, dropdowns, revealing additional information, or rendering data\ntables and visualizations were all designed with productive motion.\n\n### Expressive motion\n\nExpressive motion delivers enthusiastic, vibrant, and highly visible movement.\nUse expressive motion for significant moments such as opening a new page,\nclicking the primary action button, or when the movement itself conveys a\nmeaning.

Currently, there are six static value tokens for\neasier implementation.\n\n| Token                   | Usage                                                         | Value |     |\n| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ----- | --- |\n| `duration--fast-01`     | Micro-interactions such as button and toggle                  | 70ms  |     |\n| `duration--fast-02`     | Micro-interactions such as fade                               | 110ms |     |\n| `duration--moderate-01` | Micro-interactions, small expansion, short distance movements | 150ms |     |\n| `duration--moderate-02` | Expansion, system communication, toast                        | 240ms |     |\n| `duration--slow-01`     | Large expansion, important system notifications               | 400ms |     |\n| `duration--slow-02`     | Background dimming                                            | 700ms |     |\n\n## Implementation\n\n### Motion design strategy\n\nFollow these steps to assess your interface for purposeful motion:\n\n1. Define the goals and values of the product.\n2. Establish information hierarchy within the view.\n3. Identify the journey you will guide users through.\n4. Identify key moments and opportunities for UI motion in the journey.\n   Examples:\n   - Give feedback, such as hover states and active state component behaviors\n     like opening a dropdown menu\n   - Solutions to a UX need, such as reducing cognitive load with progressive\n     disclosure\n   - Providing guidance, such as revealing a call to action to draw users’\n     attention\n5. Assign or determine either productive or expressive motion\n6. Prototype and test\n\n### Evaluation checklist\n\n1. Is your motion purposeful?\n   - What problem is motion solving?\n   - Does it enhance the user's understanding of an action?\n2. Is your motion responsive?\n   - Do user actions receive immediate feedback that's seen and felt?\n   - Do micro-interactions use `ease-out` on user input?\n   - Do micro-interactions fall within a static duration ranging from 90–120 ms?\n   - If there are large, or full screen, transitions in your product, are there\n     continuous elements in your transition to guide the user?\n3. Is your motion meticulous?\n   - Did you use the appropriate easing curves?\n   - Is each motion individually considered?\n   - Do related movements have a unified relationship with each other?\n   - Is the motion effective across all screen sizes? Keep in mind that on\n     mobile screens, subtle motions may be easily missed.\n4. Is your motion unobtrusive?\n   - The best interface motion may go unnoticed, because it often keeps users\n     engaged with their tasks. Is your motion frequently noticed by average\n     users? If so, consider removing or minimizing it.\n\n### Adaptive interface motion design\n\nA large population of users exist with impaired vision or impaired ability to\nperceive and handle motion in UI. In addition, not all devices are powerful\nenough to smoothly perform all the motion you would like, no matter how\nessential the motion design is. Always provide alternatives for interface state\ntransitions. Consider simplified or reduced motion designs for mobile and\ntablet. Make sure there is always a way to communicate similar messages\nstatically.\n\n## Resources\n\n<Row className=\"resource-card-group\">\n  <Column colMd={4} colLg={4} noGutterSm>\n    <ResourceCard\n      subTitle=\"IBM Motion Generator\"\n      href=\"https://ibm.github.io/motion/\"\n    >\n\n<MdxIcon name=\"bee\" />\n\n  </ResourceCard>\n  </Column>\n  <Column colMd={4} colLg={4} noGutterSm>\n    <ResourceCard\n      subTitle=\"Elements package: Motion\"\n      href=\"https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/tree/master/packages/motion\"\n    >\n\n<MdxIcon name=\"github\" />\n\n  </ResourceCard>\n  </Column>\n</Row>\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"c205d6d4926536d77856351a03af92c9","counter":1658,"owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Motion","description":"Motion can bring the screen to life, guide users through complex experiences, and help move them forward—from here to there, now to next, start to finish—and make progress.","tabs":["Overview","Choreography","Code"]},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Motion\ndescription:\n  Motion can bring the screen to life, guide users through complex experiences,\n  and help move them forward—from here to there, now to next, start to\n  finish—and make progress.\ntabs: ['Overview', 'Choreography', 'Code']\n---\n\nimport { Tab } from 'carbon-components-react';\n\n<PageDescription>\n\nMotion can bring the screen to life, guide users through complex experiences,\nand help move them forward—from here to there, now to next, start to finish—and\nmake progress.\n\n</PageDescription>\n\n<AnchorLinks>\n\n<AnchorLink>Carbon in motion</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Style</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Easing</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Duration</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Implementation</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Resources</AnchorLink>\n\n</AnchorLinks>\n\n<Video vimeoId=\"281513709\" />\n\n## Carbon in motion\n\n[Carbon components](../../components/overview/) have motion built in for\nmicrointeractions.

Currently, there are six static value tokens for\neasier implementation.\n\n| Token                   | Usage                                                         | Value |     |\n| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ----- | --- |\n| `duration--fast-01`     | Micro-interactions such as button and toggle                  | 70ms  |     |\n| `duration--fast-02`     | Micro-interactions such as fade                               | 110ms |     |\n| `duration--moderate-01` | Micro-interactions, small expansion, short distance movements | 150ms |     |\n| `duration--moderate-02` | Expansion, system communication, toast                        | 240ms |     |\n| `duration--slow-01`     | Large expansion, important system notifications               | 400ms |     |\n| `duration--slow-02`     | Background dimming                                            | 700ms |     |\n\n## Implementation\n\n### Motion design strategy\n\nFollow these steps to assess your interface for purposeful motion:\n\n1. Define the goals and values of the product.\n2. Establish information hierarchy within the view.\n3. Identify the journey you will guide users through.\n4. Identify key moments and opportunities for UI motion in the journey.\n   Examples:\n   - Give feedback, such as hover states and active state component behaviors\n     like opening a dropdown menu\n   - Solutions to a UX need, such as reducing cognitive load with progressive\n     disclosure\n   - Providing guidance, such as revealing a call to action to draw users’\n     attention\n5. Assign or determine either productive or expressive motion\n6. Prototype and test\n\n### Evaluation checklist\n\n1. Is your motion purposeful?\n   - What problem is motion solving?\n   - Does it enhance the user's understanding of an action?\n2. Is your motion responsive?\n   - Do user actions receive immediate feedback that's seen and felt?\n   - Do micro-interactions use `ease-out` on user input?\n   - Do micro-interactions fall within a static duration ranging from 90–120 ms?\n   - If there are large, or full screen, transitions in your product, are there\n     continuous elements in your transition to guide the user?\n3. Is your motion meticulous?\n   - Did you use the appropriate easing curves?\n   - Is each motion individually considered?\n   - Do related movements have a unified relationship with each other?\n   - Is the motion effective across all screen sizes? Keep in mind that on\n     mobile screens, subtle motions may be easily missed.\n4. Is your motion unobtrusive?\n   - The best interface motion may go unnoticed, because it often keeps users\n     engaged with their tasks. Is your motion frequently noticed by average\n     users? If so, consider removing or minimizing it.\n\n### Adaptive interface motion design\n\nA large population of users exist with impaired vision or impaired ability to\nperceive and handle motion in UI. In addition, not all devices are powerful\nenough to smoothly perform all the motion you would like, no matter how\nessential the motion design is. Always provide alternatives for interface state\ntransitions. Consider simplified or reduced motion designs for mobile and\ntablet. Make sure there is always a way to communicate similar messages\nstatically.\n\n## Resources\n\n<Row className=\"resource-card-group\">\n  <Column colMd={4} colLg={4} noGutterSm>\n    <ResourceCard\n      subTitle=\"IBM Motion Generator\"\n      href=\"https://ibm.github.io/motion/\"\n    >\n\n<MdxIcon name=\"bee\" />\n\n  </ResourceCard>\n  </Column>\n  <Column colMd={4} colLg={4} noGutterSm>\n    <ResourceCard\n      subTitle=\"Elements package: Motion\"\n      href=\"https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/tree/master/packages/motion\"\n    >\n\n<MdxIcon name=\"github\" />\n\n  </ResourceCard>\n  </Column>\n</Row>\n","fileAbsolutePath":"/Users/jvernon/Documents/Design System/carbon/carbon-website/src/pages/guidelines/motion/overview.mdx"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1364590287","2102389209","2102389209","2456312558","2746626797","2746626797","3018647132","3018647132","3037994772","3037994772","63531786","63531786","768070550"]}
