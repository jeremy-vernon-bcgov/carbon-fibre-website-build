This helps to reinforce the meaning behind a\nmovement and improves the user’s proficiency using the interface.\n\nIn the example below, both expanding a row of a data table and opening a\ndropdown use a chevron and share a similar intent—to reveal content hidden in a\nseam. Therefore, they should use the same motion style (productive) and easing\n(entrance, standard).
