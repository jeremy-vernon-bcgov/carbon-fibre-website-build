One way to think about it is that\nvoice is always consistent, but tone often changes depending on context.\n\n### Voice\n\nVoice is the foundation for communicating about IBM products and delivering\nbrand messages. At IBM, our voice expresses the core of our personality, while\nbringing comfort, ease, and a sense of connection to our users. Through careful\nuse of the IBM voice, we help empower users to meet their business goals.\n\n### Tone\n\nTone conveys an attitude toward both the subject matter and the reader. All\ncontent – whether it's introductory text on the UI, an error message, or a topic\nin the docs – tells part of a bigger story. Good storytellers are skilled in two\nmain areas: what they are saying (the substantive content) and how to say it to\nany given audience (the style and tone in which it is presented). Be a good\nstoryteller.\n\n## Conversational levels\n\nContent should never feel complex, distant, or disjointed. Rather, it should\nfeel like a conversation with a smart friend – personal, relatable, helpful, and\nengaging. Do not mistake conversational style for sloppy writing! Conversational\ncontent still needs to be clear, concise, and easy to understand. The best\ncontent creates a connection with the user.\n\nHere's a quick guide to conversational levels based on the six stages of the\nuser journey:\n\n### Less conversational\n\n#### Instructional content for how to complete a task (e.g. steps)\n\n“Go to Avatar icon > Account > Notifications to set up general account and\nspending notifications.
