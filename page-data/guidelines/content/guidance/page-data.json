This style is\npredominantly lowercase. Capitalize only the initial letter of the first word in\nthe text and other words that require capitalization, such as proper nouns. For\nexample, labels in a form would be written as “First name” and “Email address”.\n\nThe image below shows a page title, tabs, a module title, link text, button\ntext, table headers, and table content all following the sentence case rule.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Sentence case for UI elements](/images/sentence_case_786.png)\n\n<Caption>Example of a product page using sentence-style capitalization</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\nSentence-style capitalization makes it easy for readers to distinguish between\ncommon nouns and proper nouns, and is generally considered the quickest form to\nread.\n\n> Do not capitalize the names of features and components unless they are sold\n> separately or are trademarked.\n>\n> <cite>- The IBM Style Guide: Conventions for Writers and Editors</cite>\n\nCarbon does not consider UI elements within a product to be proper nouns. Nor\ndoes Carbon support a concept of “important words” or “specialness”. Determining\nwhether something is important or special is highly subjective and can result in\ninconsistencies across an organization.\n\nUnless the name is a product or service name, or is trademarked, always use\nsentence-style capitalization.\n\nIn the following examples, the capitalization shows that Padlock, Visual\nRecognition, and IBM Cloud are either products or services.\n\n<DoDontRow>\n  <DoDont\n    text=\"Secure your enterprise applications with Padlock.\"\n    aspectRatio=\"1:1\"\n  />\n  <DoDont\n    text=\"Visual Recognition is a service on IBM Cloud.\"\n    aspectRatio=\"1:1\"\n  />\n</DoDontRow>\n\n### Referring to UI elements\n\nWhen writing about a UI element, use the same capitalization as used in the UI.\nFor example, if an input field is labeled “Name” then you refer to this as the\nName input field. Similarly, if a drop-down menu has the label “Country” next to\nit, then it is correct to refer to the Country drop-down menu. Where a product\npage is titled “My network,” you refer to this in writing as follows: “Enter\nyour network information in the My network page.”\n\n<DoDontRow>\n  <DoDont\n    text=\"To enter network information, go to the My network page.\"\n    caption=\"How to refer to UI elements in text\"\n    aspectRatio=\"1:1\"\n  />\n  <DoDont\n    type=\"dont\"\n    text=\"To enter network information, go to the My Network page.\"\n    aspectRatio=\"1:1\"\n  />\n</DoDontRow>\n\n### When to use capital letters\n\nCapital letters are reserved for the following:\n\n- “Carbon” or the “Carbon Design System” (i.e. the name of IBM’s official design\n  system)\n- “IBM” or any other company or organization name\n- Any official, trademarked product or service (whether from IBM or not) -\n  unless they intentionally use a lowercase letter at the beginning, such as the\n  iPhone\n- Any initialisms (e.g. BBC, HTML, etc.) or acronyms (e.g. NASA, NATO, etc.)\n- Any people\n- Any country / place names\n- When referring to any UI labels that are themselves capitalized\n- When the word begins a sentence or phrase\n\nIf it’s not in the list above, it should not be capitalized.\n\nSometimes official company and product names use non-standard capitalization. If\nyou refer to any of these, ensure you write them accurately. Here are some\nexamples (all written correctly):\n\n- developerWorks\n- GitHub\n- iTunes\n- JavaScript\n- WebSphere\n\n### Do not use title case capitalization\n\n**Title (or headline) case capitalization** is where the first letter of most\nwords is capitalized, but not articles, conjunctions, or prepositions (except if\nany of these are the first or last word in the sentence or phrase).\n\nTitle case is difficult to implement consistently across an organization\nbecause:\n\n1. It requires everyone who writes any copy to understand and follow fairly\n   complex grammatical rules about which words should and shouldn't be\n   capitalized, and\n\n1. It relies on a subjective viewpoint of what is considered “important” or\n   “special” and that viewpoint being communicated or understood somehow.\n\nTitle case can also slow reading and comprehension down as it is more difficult\nfor readers to distinguish between proper nouns and common nouns.\n\n<DoDontRow>\n  <DoDont\n    text=\"Secure your enterprise applications with Padlock.\"\n    caption=\"Only capitalize proper nouns, such as product names.\"\n    aspectRatio=\"1:1\"\n  />\n  <DoDont\n    type=\"dont\"\n    text=\"Secure your Enterprise Applications with Padlock.\"\n    aspectRatio=\"1:1\"\n  />\n</DoDontRow>\n\n### Do not use all caps capitalization\n\n**All caps (or uppercase) capitalization** is where every letter is capitalized.\n\nAll caps capitalization has been shown to be slower to read (especially when\ntext is more than a few words) as individual letter shapes are less\ndistinguishable from each other—they are the same height and have no ascenders\nor descenders. This style also typically requires more space in the UI per\nletter than sentence case does.\n\nIn addition, it can be difficult for the reader to distinguish between proper\nnouns and common nouns. In the first example below, it's easy to distinguish\nproduct names from features whereas it takes longer to make these distinctions\nwhen the text is in all caps.\n\n<DoDontRow>\n  <DoDont\n    text=\"Get started with Watson Studio to build, test, and deploy your own custom models to iOS.\"\n    aspectRatio=\"1:1\"\n  />\n  <DoDont\n    type=\"dont\"\n    text=\"GET STARTED WITH WATSON STUDIO TO BUILD, TEST, AND DEPLOY YOU OWN CUSTOM MODELS TO IOS.\"\n    aspectRatio=\"1:1\"\n  />\n</DoDontRow>\n\n### Capitalizing proper nouns\n\nThe names of people, places, and products are proper nouns and therefore all\ntake initial capitals. Examples of proper nouns are:\n\n- Eliot Noyes\n- IBM Watson Studio\n- Paris, France\n- Porsche Boxster\n\nThere are many words that can act as either a common noun or a proper noun,\ndepending on the context. So, you always need to think about how the word is\nbeing used. Here are some examples:\n\n| Word                | Used as a common noun                            | Used as a proper noun                              |\n| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |\n| agile               | The group uses agile tools and processes         | Debs referred her manager to the Agile Manifesto   |\n| design              | Jodi works in the design organization            | Jodi works for IBM Design                          |\n| editor              | Joe used a text editor to update the config file | Joe used IBM Flow Editor to define his data models |\n| front end developer | Jane is hoping to recruit a front end developer  | Megan’s job title is Senior Front End Developer    |\n\n### Capitalizing abbreviations\n\n**IBM product and service names**\n\nWhen referencing the name of any IBM product, use the official (full) name, not\nan abbreviation or just the product name initials, unless a shortened name has\nbeen specifically approved, as with IBM CICS.\n\n<DoDontRow>\n  <DoDont\n    text=\"Experience WebSphere Application Server on IBM Cloud...\"\n    aspectRatio=\"1:1\"\n  />\n  <DoDont type=\"dont\" text=\"Experience WAS on IBM Cloud...\" aspectRatio=\"1:1\" />\n</DoDontRow>\n\nUse all uppercase letters for well-recognized abbreviations. This applies to\nboth initialisms, such as IBM, and to acronyms, such as GIF.\n\n- ASCII\n- CAPTCHA\n- FAQ\n- HTML\n- OK (not Ok or Okay)\n- WDSL\n\nIf there's a chance that an abbreviation might not be known to the target\naudience, it's good practice to spell it out in full the first time you use it.\nHowever, don't spell out commonly known abbreviations, for example PDF, CEO,\nAM/PM.\n\n### Capitalizing all other words\n\nUnless the word begins a sentence, phrase, or UI element name, don't give it a\ncapital letter.\n\nDon't give a word a capital letter to denote “specialness”. If you want to\nemphasize a particular word or phrase within a sentence, use italic or bold\nformatting (but not both).\n\n<DoDontRow>\n  <DoDont\n    text=\"You can use a global policy to apply changes to all users.\"\n    aspectRatio=\"1:1\"\n  />\n  <DoDont\n    type=\"dont\"\n    text=\"You can use a Global Policy to apply changes to all users.\"\n    aspectRatio=\"1:1\"\n  />\n</DoDontRow>\n\n## Active and passive voice\n\nThe _active voice_ is direct and punchy, and emphasizes the subject of the\nsentence. The subject clearly “acts upon” the verb (hence, “active”). For\nexample, “John ate the apple”. In situations where either voice will work,\ngenerally choose the active voice for more directness.\n\n<DoDontRow>\n  <DoDont\n    caption=\"Do use active voice when appropriate.\"\n    text=\"Next, the admin configures access privileges.\"\n    aspectRatio=\"1:1\"\n  />\n  <DoDont\n    type=\"dont\"\n    caption=\"Don’t use passive voice when active voice will suffice.\"\n    text=\"Next, access privileges are configured by the admin.\"\n    aspectRatio=\"1:1\"\n  />\n</DoDontRow>\n\nThe _passive voice_, on the other hand, flips the construction so that the\nsubject is secondary to the verb and object (hence, “passive”). Often, the\nsubject is not even included in the sentence. For example, “_The apple was eaten\nby John_” or just “_The apple was eaten_”. Only sentences that contain direct\nobjects can be constructed in the passive voice. Thus, “_John ate_” cannot be\nconstructed passively.\n\nThe passive voice makes for a more natural tone in certain use cases. For\nexample, if the true subject of the sentence is a system, and the human is\nsecondary, passive voice can be acceptable.\n\n<DoDontRow>\n  <DoDont\n    caption=\"Do use passive voice when appropriate.\"\n    text=\"The database needs to be rebooted.\"\n    aspectRatio=\"1:1\"\n  />\n  <DoDont\n    type=\"dont\"\n    caption=\"Don’t use active voice when passive voice is more appropriate.\"\n    text=\"Someone needs to reboot the database.\"\n    aspectRatio=\"1:1\"\n  />\n</DoDontRow>\n\n## First and second person\n\nEngage your readers by using second person **(you, your)** where appropriate.\nFirst person **(I, we, our)** focuses on the writer rather than the audience,\nwhich is rarely appropriate in UI or technical contexts. Avoid the first person\nunless you have a compelling reason to use it.\n\nOne exception to this is in the case of possessive adjectives in the UI. You can\nuse first person in headings or labels that are very specific to the user or\ncustomer data, such as “My Account” or “My Usage”. In explanatory text for the\nheading or label, however, use second person. For example, _“Your usage is\ncalculated from the first day of the month”._\n\n## Formal vs. casual tone\n\nWhile a more formal tone is often appropriate for technical and business\nwriting, a more casual tone is becoming increasingly accepted (and expected) in\nUI and supporting materials.\n\n- Don't be afraid to use **contractions**. When they fit the context and improve\n  flow, go for it.\n- Beginning sentences with **and, but, or so** is not always forbidden. When it\n  allows for shorter, scannable sentences, they can be used. Do not overuse\n  these devices, especially in instructional content. For example, _“You can\n  deploy an app to the cloud during lunch hour. But it's not required.”_ works\n  for _Discover, Try, Buy_ experiences.\n- It's acceptable to use **questions in headings**. In both UIs and\n  documentation, questions can be used to further conversational style. But\n  don't overuse them, as they can add to noise. Make sure headings that use\n  questions are meaningful. In a UI, questions can also be used in a\n  confirmation prompt in a dialog box. For example, _“Do you want to close\n  without saving?”_\n- Use **exclamation marks** only positively, not negatively. Make sure you use\n  no more than one exclamation mark in a context, such as a single window or a\n  single Docs topic.\n\n<DoDontRow>\n  <DoDont\n    caption=\"Do use exclamation points for positive messages.\"\n    text=\"Your IBM Cloud account is ready!\"\n    aspectRatio=\"1:1\"\n  />\n  <DoDont\n    type=\"dont\"\n    caption=\"Don’t use exclamation points for negative messages\"\n    text=\"You have reached your usage limit!!\"\n    aspectRatio=\"1:1\"\n  />\n</DoDontRow>\n\n#### Terms of politeness\n\nOften overused, these terms can convey the wrong tone for technical material,\nand are not regarded the same way in all cultures. Use terms such as “please”\nand “thank you” carefully.\n\n<DoDontRow>\n  <DoDont\n    caption=\"Do use terms of politeness in a UI only when the user is being inconvenienced.\"\n    text=\"Indexing might take a few minutes. Please wait.\"\n    aspectRatio=\"1:1\"\n  />\n  <DoDont\n    type=\"dont\"\n    caption=\"Don’t use terms of politeness superfluously.\"\n    text=\"Please create a subscription account to get full access to the catalog.\"\n    aspectRatio=\"1:1\"\n  />\n</DoDontRow>\n\n## Can, may, and might\n\n#### Terms of ability\n\nThese terms are often misused. Remember, “can” implies ability, and “may”\nimplies permission (and sometimes uncertainty).\n\n<DoDontRow>\n  <DoDont\n    caption=\"Do use ‘can’ to express ability.\"\n    text=\"You can use the command line interface to update your app.\"\n    aspectRatio=\"1:1\"\n  />\n  <DoDont\n    type=\"dont\"\n    caption=\"Don’t use ‘may’ when you mean ‘can.’\"\n    text=\"You may use the command line interface to update your app.\"\n    aspectRatio=\"1:1\"\n  />\n</DoDontRow>\n\n#### Terms of possibility\n\nThese terms can also be confusing. Remember, when either “may” or “might” will\nwork, generally go with “might” to avoid confusion with the multiple meanings of\n“may”.\n\n<DoDontRow>\n  <DoDont\n    caption=\"Do use ‘might’ to clarify possibility.\"\n    text=\"You might need more advanced features when integrating with another app.\"\n    aspectRatio=\"1:1\"\n  />\n  <DoDont\n    type=\"dont\"\n    caption=\"Don’t use ‘may’ when ‘might’ will work.\"\n    text=\"You may need more advanced features when integrating with another app.\"\n    aspectRatio=\"1:1\"\n  />\n</DoDontRow>\n\n## References\n\nEric Radzinski, Leslie McDonald, Amy Laird, Jana Jenkins, Peter Hayward, and\nFrancis DeRespinis,\n[The IBM Style Guide: Conventions for Writers and Editors](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/the-ibm-style/9780132118989/),\n(IBM Press, 2011)\n\nTom Waterton,\n[How to emphasize key words in your text](https://medium.com/@tomwaterton/how-to-emphasize-key-words-in-your-text-b8738f146972),\n(Medium, 2017)\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"b248cd4b3381d04037b659bccec3eef2","counter":1664,"owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Content","description":"Inconsistencies in grammar and style interrupt concentration.

For example, _“Your usage is\ncalculated from the first day of the month”._\n\n## Formal vs. casual tone\n\nWhile a more formal tone is often appropriate for technical and business\nwriting, a more casual tone is becoming increasingly accepted (and expected) in\nUI and supporting materials.\n\n- Don't be afraid to use **contractions**. When they fit the context and improve\n  flow, go for it.\n- Beginning sentences with **and, but, or so** is not always forbidden. When it\n  allows for shorter, scannable sentences, they can be used. Do not overuse\n  these devices, especially in instructional content. For example, _“You can\n  deploy an app to the cloud during lunch hour. But it's not required.”_ works\n  for _Discover, Try, Buy_ experiences.\n- It's acceptable to use **questions in headings**. In both UIs and\n  documentation, questions can be used to further conversational style. But\n  don't overuse them, as they can add to noise. Make sure headings that use\n  questions are meaningful. In a UI, questions can also be used in a\n  confirmation prompt in a dialog box. For example, _“Do you want to close\n  without saving?”_\n- Use **exclamation marks** only positively, not negatively. Make sure you use\n  no more than one exclamation mark in a context, such as a single window or a\n  single Docs topic.\n\n<DoDontRow>\n  <DoDont\n    caption=\"Do use exclamation points for positive messages.\"\n    text=\"Your IBM Cloud account is ready!\"\n    aspectRatio=\"1:1\"\n  />\n  <DoDont\n    type=\"dont\"\n    caption=\"Don’t use exclamation points for negative messages\"\n    text=\"You have reached your usage limit!!\"\n    aspectRatio=\"1:1\"\n  />\n</DoDontRow>\n\n#### Terms of politeness\n\nOften overused, these terms can convey the wrong tone for technical material,\nand are not regarded the same way in all cultures. Use terms such as “please”\nand “thank you” carefully.\n\n<DoDontRow>\n  <DoDont\n    caption=\"Do use terms of politeness in a UI only when the user is being inconvenienced.\"\n    text=\"Indexing might take a few minutes. Please wait.\"\n    aspectRatio=\"1:1\"\n  />\n  <DoDont\n    type=\"dont\"\n    caption=\"Don’t use terms of politeness superfluously.\"\n    text=\"Please create a subscription account to get full access to the catalog.\"\n    aspectRatio=\"1:1\"\n  />\n</DoDontRow>\n\n## Can, may, and might\n\n#### Terms of ability\n\nThese terms are often misused. Remember, “can” implies ability, and “may”\nimplies permission (and sometimes uncertainty).\n\n<DoDontRow>\n  <DoDont\n    caption=\"Do use ‘can’ to express ability.\"\n    text=\"You can use the command line interface to update your app.\"\n    aspectRatio=\"1:1\"\n  />\n  <DoDont\n    type=\"dont\"\n    caption=\"Don’t use ‘may’ when you mean ‘can.’\"\n    text=\"You may use the command line interface to update your app.\"\n    aspectRatio=\"1:1\"\n  />\n</DoDontRow>\n\n#### Terms of possibility\n\nThese terms can also be confusing. Remember, when either “may” or “might” will\nwork, generally go with “might” to avoid confusion with the multiple meanings of\n“may”.\n\n<DoDontRow>\n  <DoDont\n    caption=\"Do use ‘might’ to clarify possibility.\"\n    text=\"You might need more advanced features when integrating with another app.\"\n    aspectRatio=\"1:1\"\n  />\n  <DoDont\n    type=\"dont\"\n    caption=\"Don’t use ‘may’ when ‘might’ will work.\"\n    text=\"You may need more advanced features when integrating with another app.\"\n    aspectRatio=\"1:1\"\n  />\n</DoDontRow>\n\n## References\n\nEric Radzinski, Leslie McDonald, Amy Laird, Jana Jenkins, Peter Hayward, and\nFrancis DeRespinis,\n[The IBM Style Guide: Conventions for Writers and Editors](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/the-ibm-style/9780132118989/),\n(IBM Press, 2011)\n\nTom Waterton,\n[How to emphasize key words in your text](https://medium.com/@tomwaterton/how-to-emphasize-key-words-in-your-text-b8738f146972),\n(Medium, 2017)\n","fileAbsolutePath":"/Users/jvernon/Documents/Design System/carbon/carbon-website/src/pages/guidelines/content/guidance.mdx"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1364590287","2102389209","2102389209","2456312558","2746626797","2746626797","3018647132","3018647132","3037994772","3037994772","63531786","63531786","768070550"]}
