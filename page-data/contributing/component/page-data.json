We encourage you to surface\nwork in progress. Someone in the community may be working on the same component\nand interested in collaborating with you.\n\n## Documentation templates\n\nOur component usage documentation typically contains three parts: usage\nguidance, style guidance, and code guidance. Some components are more complex\nthan others but you should cover each topic included in these templates.\n\n### Usage guidance for components with one type\n\nUse this template for documenting components with only one type, that is, no\nvariants. You can see this template in use for\n[Accordion](/components/accordion/usage) and\n[Checkbox](/components/checkbox/usage).\n\n```markdown\n---\ntitle: Component name\ndescription: Explains what the component is in one or two sentences.\ntabs: ['Usage', 'Style', 'Code', 'Accessibility']\n---\n\n<PageDescription>\n\n<!-- Explains what the component is in one or two sentences. -->\n\n</PageDescription>\n\n<AnchorLinks>\n\n<AnchorLink>Overview</AnchorLink> <AnchorLink>Live demo</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Formatting</AnchorLink> <AnchorLink>Content</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Behaviors</AnchorLink> <AnchorLink>Modifiers</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Related</AnchorLink> <AnchorLink>References</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Feedback</AnchorLink>\n\n</AnchorLinks>\n\n## Overview\n\n<!--\nInclude a paragraph or two that describes the primary use cases for the component and details about how it helps the user achieve any tasks.\n\nExample:\n\n*The accordion component delivers large amounts of content in a small space through progressive disclosure. The header title give the user a high level overview of the content allowing the user to decide which sections to read.*\n-->\n\n### When to use\n\n<!--\nInclude examples for when to use this component and how it addresses the use case / solves a problem for the user.\n\nExample:\n\n*Dropdowns can be used in forms on full pages, in modals, or on side panels. The dropdown component is used to filter or sort contents on a page. It is a stylized version of the select component, and can be styled as needed.*\n-->\n\n### When not to use (optional)\n\n<!--\nIf there are two similar components that are used for different use cases, spell that out here and explain which component to use for each use case.\n\nExample:\n\n*It is best practice not to use a dropdown if there are two or fewer options to choose from. In this case, use a radio button group instead.*\n-->\n\n## Live demo\n\n<!--Include component demo here.-->\n\n## Formatting\n\n### Anatomy\n\n<!--The anatomy section has a set format and includes an example component with numbered callouts to each of the component elements. A list below provides the name of the element in bold and explains its purpose. Be sure to note if the element is optional.\n\nSee [Notification](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/notification/usage#anatomy) for an example.-->\n\n### Sizing (optional)\n\n<!--List out any component sizes that are available and provide some guidance about how to choose the best size for the use case. Other topics that may be covered here include considerations around maximum heights, maximum widths, and responsive resizing.\n\nExample:\n\n*There are four responsive modal sizes: xs, small, default, large. Choose a size that works best for the amount of modal content you have. Modals with short messages should use a xs or small modal to avoid long single lines; for complex components, like data table the default or large modal will be more accommodating.*\n-->\n\n### Alignment (optional)\n\n<!--\nConsider the relationship with other items that are the same. How do they sit in groups? What is their juxtaposition. For example:\n\n- Checkbox, radio button—what is their relationship horizontally and vertically?\n- Notifications—how do they stack?\n- Button—what happens when there's more than one?\n\nWe have some alignment content in the Structure section of the Style tab, so consider the relationship between the two tabs and include a cross-reference if necessary.\n\nExample:\n\n*Inside of a modal, body copy, including titles, have a 20% margin-right. However, form inputs and other components expand the full width of a modal window.*\n-->\n\n### Placement\n\n<!--\nDiscuss placement of the component in a broader context, that is:\n\n- alongside other components\n- within the grid\n\nYou may want to include a link here to the Structure section of the Style tab.\n\nExample:\n\n*Accordions can be placed with main page content or placed inside of a container such as a side panel or tile. When placing an accordion on the 2x Grid the indented title aligns to the grid columns and the top and bottom borders hang in the gutter.*\n-->\n\n## Content\n\n### Main elements\n\n<!--\nIdentify the content elements within the component, for example, title, label, placeholder text, links. Use H4s for the element names and provide guidelines underneath for each element.\n\nBriefly explain any particular rules such as phrase structure, word limits, and character limits. Where there's more than one rule, use bullets to list out the multiple rules for ease of reading. If necessary, refer out to main content guidelines for more detailed information, for example, capitalization, or recommended action labels.\n\nSee [Checkbox](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/checkbox/usage#content) and [Modal](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/modal/usage#content) for examples.\n-->\n\n### Overflow content\n\n<!--\nExplain how overflow content should be handled.\n\nExample:\n\n*When the accordion content is longer than the viewport the whole accordion should vertically scroll. Content should not scroll inside of an individual panel. Content should never scroll horizontally in an accordion.*\n-->\n\n### Further guidance\n\n<!--\nFor further content guidance, see Carbon's [content guidelines]([https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/content/general](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/content/general)).\n-->\n\n## Behaviors\n\n<!--\nDetermine which component behaviors apply to your component, and include from the following sections as needed.\n-->\n\n### States\n\n<!--\nIf including any information on this topic, include the following line:\n\nFor detailed visual information about the various states for this component, see the Style tab.\n\nExample:\n\n*The accordion component has two main states: collapsed and expanded. The chevron icon at the end of the accordion indicates which state the accordion is in. The chevron points down to indicate collapsed and up to indicate expanded.*\n-->\n\n### Interactions\n\n<!--\nInclude all possible interactions with the component, including:\n\n- Mouse\n- Keyboard\n- Screen readers\n\nSee [Accordion](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/accordion/usage#interactions) for an example.\n-->\n\n### Validation\n\n<!--\nInclude any guidelines for data validation and accompanying messaging. See [Form](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/form/usage/#validation-and-errors) for an example.\n-->\n\n### Responsive behavior\n\n<!--\nInclude details about how the component should behave in responsive situations.\n-->\n\n### Default selection\n\n<!--\nCover guidance around default settings and provide rationale. See [Form](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/form/usage/#default-values) and [Radio button](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/radio-button/usage/#default-selection) for examples.\n-->\n\n### Clickable areas\n\n<!--\nProvide details about the clickable areas of the component.\n-->\n\n### Loading\n\n<!--\nIf applicable, use this section to cross reference to the specific loading type in the [Loading component](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/loading-pattern) and/or the [Loading pattern](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/loading-pattern/).\n-->\n\n## Modifiers\n\n<!--\nThe modifiers section shows different ways of styling the component. Here are some examples:\n\n- adding an icon to a [button](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/button/usage/#variations)\n- adding a button to a [notification](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/notification/usage/#anatomy)\n- styling a dropdown to appear inline with other content\n- using high and low contrast styles for [notifications](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/notification/usage/#high-and-low-contrast)\n- using a \"light\" variant in a [text input](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/text-input/code)\n-->\n\n## Related\n\n<!--\nDid you reference other components or patterns? List them here.\n\nIf necessary, clarify any differences between this component and related components.\n-->\n\n## References\n\n<!--\nInclude any research, citations, books or articles that you found helpful.\n-->\n\n## Feedback\n\n<!--Include a request for feedback here.-->\n\nHelp us improve this component by providing feedback, asking questions, and\nleaving any other comments on\n[GitHub](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feedback&template=feedback.md).\n```\n\n### Usage guidance with multiple types\n\nUse this template for documenting components that have multiple types or\nvariants.

The native select works more easily with a native form when submitting data and is also easier to use on a mobile platform.*\n-->\n\n### Types\n\n<!--\nTypes are different variations of the component with significant visual or interaction differences, for example, primary button vs. secondary button vs. ghost button. Minor visual differences, such as button height, should be placed under modifiers.\n\nInclude a table with types of components and their purpose. Include links on the type names to the types sections below. See [Modal](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/modal/usage#passive-modal) for an example.\n-->\n\n## Live demo\n\n<!--\nInclude live demo here.\n-->\n\n## Formatting\n\n<!--\n### Anatomy\n\nThe anatomy section has a set format and includes an example component with numbered callouts to each of the component elements. A list below provides the name of the element in bold and explains its purpose. Be sure to note if the element is optional.\n\nSee [Notification](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/notification/usage#anatomy) for an example.\n-->\n\n### Sizing (optional)\n\n<!--\nList out any component sizes that are available and provide some guidance about how to choose the best size for the use case.

Forms can be placed on a full page, in a modal or in a side panel. A checkbox can also be used for agreeing to terms and conditions or to filter information.*\n-->\n\n## Content\n\n### Main elements\n\n<!--\nIdentify the content elements within the component, for example, title, label, placeholder text, body copy, links.

A rationale\n\nExplain how your component will add value to the system. Carbon serves the\nwidest possible range of products, and contributions that increase the scope of\nthe system are more likely to be accepted. Be sure to include any user\nexperience and interaction descriptions.\n\n#### 2. A design spec\n\nCreate sizing and styling annotations for all aspects of the component. This\nspec should provide a developer with everything they need to create the design\nin code. Check out our\n[production guidelines](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/wiki/Production-guidelines#spec-guidelines)\nto get started.\n\nYou should include color tokens and type tokens used.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Example of a design spec](images/content-switcher-style-1.png)\n\n<Caption>Example of a design spec</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n#### 3. A Sketch symbol\n\nAny new components or changes to existing components will also live in the\n[Carbon Sketch kit](/designing/kits/sketch) and so we'll need a Sketch symbol.\nCheck out\n[Sketch's guide](https://www.sketch.com/docs/symbols/creating-symbols/) for\ncreating a symbol.\n\nThis symbol can be contributed with the asset or enhancement, but must be added\nto the kit by one of its maintainers. To contribute a symbol, simply open an\nissue in the\n[kit repo](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-design-kit/issues).\n\n#### 4. Usage documentation\n\nFor guidance, see our\n[production guidelines](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/wiki/Production-guidelines#spec-guidelines)\nand [documentation templates](#documentation-templates) above. Reading through\nexisting component documentation on the site will help also. Color and type\ntokens will live in the style tab.\n\n#### 5. Working code\n\nThe component or enhancement must be built in one of our supported frameworks\n(Vanilla, React, Vue, or Angular). See the contribution guidelines for the\nspecific repo you intend to contribute to.\n\n<Row className=\"resource-card-group\">\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4} noGutterSm>\n    <ResourceCard\n      subTitle=\"Contribute to Carbon Components React\"\n      href=\"https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md\"\n      >\n\n<MdxIcon name=\"github\" />\n\n  </ResourceCard>\n</Column>\n<Column colLg={4} colMd={4} noGutterSm>\n  <ResourceCard\n    subTitle=\"Contribute to Carbon Components Angular\"\n    href=\"https://github.com/IBM/carbon-components-angular/blob/master/README.md#contributing\"\n    >\n\n<MdxIcon name=\"github\" />\n\n  </ResourceCard>\n\n</Column>\n\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4} noGutterSm>\n    <ResourceCard\n      subTitle=\"Contribute to Carbon Components Vue\"\n      href=\"https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-components-vue/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md\"\n      >\n\n<MdxIcon name=\"github\" />\n\n  </ResourceCard>\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n#### 6.

Some components are more complex\nthan others but you should cover each topic included in these templates.\n\n### Usage guidance for components with one type\n\nUse this template for documenting components with only one type, that is, no\nvariants. You can see this template in use for\n[Accordion](/components/accordion/usage) and\n[Checkbox](/components/checkbox/usage).\n\n```markdown\n---\ntitle: Component name\ndescription: Explains what the component is in one or two sentences.\ntabs: ['Usage', 'Style', 'Code', 'Accessibility']\n---\n\n<PageDescription>\n\n<!-- Explains what the component is in one or two sentences. -->\n\n</PageDescription>\n\n<AnchorLinks>\n\n<AnchorLink>Overview</AnchorLink> <AnchorLink>Live demo</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Formatting</AnchorLink> <AnchorLink>Content</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Behaviors</AnchorLink> <AnchorLink>Modifiers</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Related</AnchorLink> <AnchorLink>References</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Feedback</AnchorLink>\n\n</AnchorLinks>\n\n## Overview\n\n<!--\nInclude a paragraph or two that describes the primary use cases for the component and details about how it helps the user achieve any tasks.\n\nExample:\n\n*The accordion component delivers large amounts of content in a small space through progressive disclosure. The header title give the user a high level overview of the content allowing the user to decide which sections to read.*\n-->\n\n### When to use\n\n<!--\nInclude examples for when to use this component and how it addresses the use case / solves a problem for the user.\n\nExample:\n\n*Dropdowns can be used in forms on full pages, in modals, or on side panels. The dropdown component is used to filter or sort contents on a page. It is a stylized version of the select component, and can be styled as needed.*\n-->\n\n### When not to use (optional)\n\n<!--\nIf there are two similar components that are used for different use cases, spell that out here and explain which component to use for each use case.\n\nExample:\n\n*It is best practice not to use a dropdown if there are two or fewer options to choose from. In this case, use a radio button group instead.*\n-->\n\n## Live demo\n\n<!--Include component demo here.-->\n\n## Formatting\n\n### Anatomy\n\n<!--The anatomy section has a set format and includes an example component with numbered callouts to each of the component elements. A list below provides the name of the element in bold and explains its purpose. Be sure to note if the element is optional.\n\nSee [Notification](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/notification/usage#anatomy) for an example.-->\n\n### Sizing (optional)\n\n<!--List out any component sizes that are available and provide some guidance about how to choose the best size for the use case. Other topics that may be covered here include considerations around maximum heights, maximum widths, and responsive resizing.\n\nExample:\n\n*There are four responsive modal sizes: xs, small, default, large. Choose a size that works best for the amount of modal content you have. Modals with short messages should use a xs or small modal to avoid long single lines; for complex components, like data table the default or large modal will be more accommodating.*\n-->\n\n### Alignment (optional)\n\n<!--\nConsider the relationship with other items that are the same. How do they sit in groups? What is their juxtaposition. For example:\n\n- Checkbox, radio button—what is their relationship horizontally and vertically?\n- Notifications—how do they stack?\n- Button—what happens when there's more than one?\n\nWe have some alignment content in the Structure section of the Style tab, so consider the relationship between the two tabs and include a cross-reference if necessary.\n\nExample:\n\n*Inside of a modal, body copy, including titles, have a 20% margin-right. However, form inputs and other components expand the full width of a modal window.*\n-->\n\n### Placement\n\n<!--\nDiscuss placement of the component in a broader context, that is:\n\n- alongside other components\n- within the grid\n\nYou may want to include a link here to the Structure section of the Style tab.\n\nExample:\n\n*Accordions can be placed with main page content or placed inside of a container such as a side panel or tile. When placing an accordion on the 2x Grid the indented title aligns to the grid columns and the top and bottom borders hang in the gutter.*\n-->\n\n## Content\n\n### Main elements\n\n<!--\nIdentify the content elements within the component, for example, title, label, placeholder text, links. Use H4s for the element names and provide guidelines underneath for each element.\n\nBriefly explain any particular rules such as phrase structure, word limits, and character limits. Where there's more than one rule, use bullets to list out the multiple rules for ease of reading. If necessary, refer out to main content guidelines for more detailed information, for example, capitalization, or recommended action labels.\n\nSee [Checkbox](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/checkbox/usage#content) and [Modal](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/modal/usage#content) for examples.\n-->\n\n### Overflow content\n\n<!--\nExplain how overflow content should be handled.\n\nExample:\n\n*When the accordion content is longer than the viewport the whole accordion should vertically scroll. Content should not scroll inside of an individual panel. Content should never scroll horizontally in an accordion.*\n-->\n\n### Further guidance\n\n<!--\nFor further content guidance, see Carbon's [content guidelines]([https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/content/general](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/content/general)).\n-->\n\n## Behaviors\n\n<!--\nDetermine which component behaviors apply to your component, and include from the following sections as needed.\n-->\n\n### States\n\n<!--\nIf including any information on this topic, include the following line:\n\nFor detailed visual information about the various states for this component, see the Style tab.\n\nExample:\n\n*The accordion component has two main states: collapsed and expanded. The chevron icon at the end of the accordion indicates which state the accordion is in. The chevron points down to indicate collapsed and up to indicate expanded.*\n-->\n\n### Interactions\n\n<!--\nInclude all possible interactions with the component, including:\n\n- Mouse\n- Keyboard\n- Screen readers\n\nSee [Accordion](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/accordion/usage#interactions) for an example.\n-->\n\n### Validation\n\n<!--\nInclude any guidelines for data validation and accompanying messaging. See [Form](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/form/usage/#validation-and-errors) for an example.\n-->\n\n### Responsive behavior\n\n<!--\nInclude details about how the component should behave in responsive situations.\n-->\n\n### Default selection\n\n<!--\nCover guidance around default settings and provide rationale. See [Form](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/form/usage/#default-values) and [Radio button](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/radio-button/usage/#default-selection) for examples.\n-->\n\n### Clickable areas\n\n<!--\nProvide details about the clickable areas of the component.\n-->\n\n### Loading\n\n<!--\nIf applicable, use this section to cross reference to the specific loading type in the [Loading component](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/loading-pattern) and/or the [Loading pattern](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/loading-pattern/).\n-->\n\n## Modifiers\n\n<!--\nThe modifiers section shows different ways of styling the component. Here are some examples:\n\n- adding an icon to a [button](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/button/usage/#variations)\n- adding a button to a [notification](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/notification/usage/#anatomy)\n- styling a dropdown to appear inline with other content\n- using high and low contrast styles for [notifications](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/notification/usage/#high-and-low-contrast)\n- using a \"light\" variant in a [text input](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/text-input/code)\n-->\n\n## Related\n\n<!--\nDid you reference other components or patterns? List them here.\n\nIf necessary, clarify any differences between this component and related components.\n-->\n\n## References\n\n<!--\nInclude any research, citations, books or articles that you found helpful.\n-->\n\n## Feedback\n\n<!--Include a request for feedback here.-->\n\nHelp us improve this component by providing feedback, asking questions, and\nleaving any other comments on\n[GitHub](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feedback&template=feedback.md).\n```\n\n### Usage guidance with multiple types\n\nUse this template for documenting components that have multiple types or\nvariants.

The native select works more easily with a native form when submitting data and is also easier to use on a mobile platform.*\n-->\n\n### Types\n\n<!--\nTypes are different variations of the component with significant visual or interaction differences, for example, primary button vs. secondary button vs. ghost button. Minor visual differences, such as button height, should be placed under modifiers.\n\nInclude a table with types of components and their purpose. Include links on the type names to the types sections below. See [Modal](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/modal/usage#passive-modal) for an example.\n-->\n\n## Live demo\n\n<!--\nInclude live demo here.\n-->\n\n## Formatting\n\n<!--\n### Anatomy\n\nThe anatomy section has a set format and includes an example component with numbered callouts to each of the component elements. A list below provides the name of the element in bold and explains its purpose. Be sure to note if the element is optional.\n\nSee [Notification](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/notification/usage#anatomy) for an example.\n-->\n\n### Sizing (optional)\n\n<!--\nList out any component sizes that are available and provide some guidance about how to choose the best size for the use case.

A rationale\n\nExplain how your component will add value to the system. Carbon serves the\nwidest possible range of products, and contributions that increase the scope of\nthe system are more likely to be accepted. Be sure to include any user\nexperience and interaction descriptions.\n\n#### 2. A design spec\n\nCreate sizing and styling annotations for all aspects of the component. This\nspec should provide a developer with everything they need to create the design\nin code. Check out our\n[production guidelines](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/wiki/Production-guidelines#spec-guidelines)\nto get started.\n\nYou should include color tokens and type tokens used.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Example of a design spec](images/content-switcher-style-1.png)\n\n<Caption>Example of a design spec</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n#### 3. A Sketch symbol\n\nAny new components or changes to existing components will also live in the\n[Carbon Sketch kit](/designing/kits/sketch) and so we'll need a Sketch symbol.\nCheck out\n[Sketch's guide](https://www.sketch.com/docs/symbols/creating-symbols/) for\ncreating a symbol.\n\nThis symbol can be contributed with the asset or enhancement, but must be added\nto the kit by one of its maintainers. To contribute a symbol, simply open an\nissue in the\n[kit repo](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-design-kit/issues).\n\n#### 4. Usage documentation\n\nFor guidance, see our\n[production guidelines](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/wiki/Production-guidelines#spec-guidelines)\nand [documentation templates](#documentation-templates) above. Reading through\nexisting component documentation on the site will help also. Color and type\ntokens will live in the style tab.\n\n#### 5. Working code\n\nThe component or enhancement must be built in one of our supported frameworks\n(Vanilla, React, Vue, or Angular). See the contribution guidelines for the\nspecific repo you intend to contribute to.\n\n<Row className=\"resource-card-group\">\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4} noGutterSm>\n    <ResourceCard\n      subTitle=\"Contribute to Carbon Components React\"\n      href=\"https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md\"\n      >\n\n<MdxIcon name=\"github\" />\n\n  </ResourceCard>\n</Column>\n<Column colLg={4} colMd={4} noGutterSm>\n  <ResourceCard\n    subTitle=\"Contribute to Carbon Components Angular\"\n    href=\"https://github.com/IBM/carbon-components-angular/blob/master/README.md#contributing\"\n    >\n\n<MdxIcon name=\"github\" />\n\n  </ResourceCard>\n\n</Column>\n\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4} noGutterSm>\n    <ResourceCard\n      subTitle=\"Contribute to Carbon Components Vue\"\n      href=\"https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-components-vue/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md\"\n      >\n\n<MdxIcon name=\"github\" />\n\n  </ResourceCard>\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n#### 6.
