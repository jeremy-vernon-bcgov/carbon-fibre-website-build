If you’re not able to complete all\nof the parts yourself, someone in the community may be able to help.\n\n## How to write a pattern\n\nWe’ve created guidelines to help you prepare a complete and comprehensive\npattern. These guidelines and the required structure are included in the\nMarkdown template below.\n\nDepending on the pattern, you may need to adjust the structure but your pattern\nshould cover all of the topics outlined here.\n\n```markdown\n## Overview\n\nThis section answers the question: “What problem does this pattern solve?”\n\n- Define the use of your pattern and what it does.\n- Explain a user’s needs and how the pattern meets those needs.\n\n### Anatomy\n\nInclude an image with callouts explaining each part of the pattern.\n\n`Show pattern in visual form`\n\n### When to use\n\nInclude a short list describing situations where this pattern could be applied.\n\nFor example, use this pattern when:\n\n- Situation 1\n- Situation 2\n\n### When not to use (optional)\n\nIf required, include a short explanation about when not to use this pattern.\n\n## The solution\n\nThis section explains the pattern in detail. Use a combination of written\nexplanations and visuals to tell the story.\n\n### Behaviors, structure, and functionality\n\n- Describe the elements, components, and content that make up the pattern.\n- Describe pattern behaviors, including guidance on interactions, and changes in\n  states and content.\n- Show the pattern in context. Use visuals throughout your written commentary to\n  illustrate your guidance.\n\nDifferent patterns require different visuals to best explain the behaviors and\nhierarchy. Choose the options that make the most sense for the story you are\ntelling. See our\n[production guidelines](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/wiki/Production-guidelines)\nfor information about creating assets for the IBM Design System.\n\n- Use annotated wireframes or sketches to explain the visual hierarchy of\n  components.\n- Create high-level user flows to explain the big picture.\n- Create a functional prototype if that is the best way to illustrate the\n  pattern's behavior.\n\nProvide a [Sketch file](https://www.sketch.com/docs/getting-started/) with any\nsymbols you've created in the development of this pattern.\n\n### Best practices\n\nList out best practices and include any design considerations that help with\nmaking choices.\n\n- Do's\n- Dont's\n\n### Other use cases\n\nIf there are use cases that require a different solution, include those here\nwith corresponding explanations and visuals. Be sure to explain the reasons for\nusing one solution over another.\n\n## Accessibility\n\nEvaluate your pattern to ensure it meets\n[accessibility standards](/guidelines/accessibility/overview) and guidelines,\nand provide details of compliance.\n\nFor example, “Users should be able to TAB into the input field of the search box\nto begin typing and press ENTER to run the search query.”\n\n## Related\n\nWhich components did you use when building this pattern? Did you reference other\npatterns? List them here.\n\nIf necessary, clarify any differences between this pattern and related patterns.\n\n## References\n\nHelp designers understand your process by explaining your rationale for the way\nyou implemented the pattern. Include any research, citations, books or articles\nthat you found helpful.\n\n## Feedback\n\nHelp us improve this pattern by providing feedback, asking questions, and\nleaving any other comments on\n[GitHub](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feedback&template=feedback.md).\n```\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"181df140b751dbc5b93104602e5e807b","counter":3076,"owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Patterns","description":"Patterns are best practice solutions for how a user achieves a goal.
