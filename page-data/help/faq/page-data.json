It is a\nseries of individual styles, components, and guidelines used for creating\nunified product experiences.\n\nTo learn more about how we work check out\n[What is Carbon](/all-about-carbon/what-is-carbon).\n\n### Who works on Carbon?\n\nCarbon has a core team of designers and front-end developers dedicated to\ndeveloping and supporting the system. There are also countless other designers\nand developers who contribute back to\n[carbon-components](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-components#contributors)\nand\n[carbon-react](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-components-react#contributors).\n\n## Contributing\n\n### How can I contribute and/or propose new components or ideas?\n\nCheck out our [contribution overview](/contributing/overview) to learn all about\nthe different ways to contribute. Thanks for the help!\n\n### I see a bug. How do I report it?\n\nFirst, make sure the problem is reproducible. Once confirmed, open an issue in\nthe appropriate GitHub repo from the following list. We will address the bug as\nsoon as we can. If you have a fix for the bug, please feel free to submit a PR\nfor it.\n\nFor larger changes, please see our\n[contribution overview](/contributing/overview).\n\n#### Design issue repos\n\n- [Design kit](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-design-kit/issues/new)\n- [Icons](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-icons/issues/new)\n- [Website](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/issues/new/choose)\n- [Components](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/new/choose)\n- [Elements](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/new/choose)\n- [Charts](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-charts/issues/new)\n- [Everything else](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/issue-tracking/issues/new)\n\n#### Code repos\n\n- [carbon-components-react](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/new/choose)\n- [carbon-components-angular](https://github.com/IBM/carbon-components-angular/issues/new)\n- [carbon-components-vanilla](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/new/choose)\n- [carbon-components-vue](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-components-vue/issues/new)\n- [carbon-charts](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-charts/issues/new)\n\n### What can I expect for a response to my bug report?\n\nIf you have a pressing bug or change it is best to make PR for the issue\nyourself. Our team works in sprints and will try to address your bug as soon as\npossible; sometimes within two or three days, but usually by the following\nsprint. Issues that are out of scope will be closed until they become a higher\npriority.\n\nTypical responses to bug reports will include:\n\n- Need more info, can't reproduce the problem\n- Won't fix, this isn't something we intend to support\n- Confirmed, will add to our roadmap (Carbon team will fix)\n- Confirmed, will accept PRs (need external member to fix)\n- Need to include design to verify this behavior is supported\n\n### What should I do if I find a component that isn't accessible?\n\nFirst, refer to the\n[Carbon accessibility guidelines](/guidelines/accessibility/overview) to confirm\nthat the component fails accessibility standards. If confirmed,\n[create a GitHub issue](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/new/choose)\nin the Components repo and describe the steps to reproduce the problem. If the\ncore Carbon team confirms the problem, we will work to fix it as quickly as\npossible.\n\n## Creating with Carbon\n\n### Which browsers are supported?\n\nCarbon components are supported in the following browsers:\n\n- IE11\n- Microsoft Edge latest\n- Firefox latest\n- Chrome latest\n- Safari latest\n\n### What languages are the components written in?\n\nCarbon is built React first. We also support vanilla JS, Angular, and Vue\nimplementations. Check out [Frameworks](/developing/frameworks/react) to learn\nmore about what you need to get started with Carbon implementations.\n\n### Where do I find mobile components?\n\nWe are currently working on a Carbon mobile Sketch kit. This kit is a work in\nprogress but is an opportunity for you to preview what we're working on and\nprovide early feedback. Find the kit on the\n[Work in progress](/whats-happening/work-in-progress) page.\n\n### Where do I find the Experimental components and patterns?\n\nThe patterns and components that were in Experimental are now in the\n[Community assets](/community/overview) section. Community assets include work\ndeveloped and maintained by the individuals and teams who use Carbon. You can\nhelp elevate these resources by contributing feedback, code, and design.\n\nNote that some of the content in Community assets is hosted on internal IBM\nsites and is only accessible to IBMers.\n\n### Where do I find charts and data visualization?\n\nCarbon charts and their corresponding assets and documentation are now in the\n[Data visualization](/data-visualization/getting-started) section.\n\n### Where can I find documentation for earlier versions of Carbon?\n\nYou can find earlier versions of Carbon documentation here:\n**[V6](http://v6.carbondesignsystem.com/)**,\n**[V7](http://v7.carbondesignsystem.com/)**,\n**[V8](http://v8.carbondesignsystem.com/)**, and\n**[V9](http://v9.carbondesignsystem.com/).**\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"e0f8b49f881ec03fe6cdccdea36a957c","counter":4937,"owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx"},"frontmatter":{"title":"FAQs","description":"What is the Carbon Design System?
