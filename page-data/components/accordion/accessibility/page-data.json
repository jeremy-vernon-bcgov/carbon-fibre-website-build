The accordion header is a button\nthat is used to expand and collapse each accordion panel. Buttons are used so\nthat the accordions are tab-able by keyboard users and accessible to screen\nreaders. `Tab` and `Shift-Tab` are used to navigate through each accordion\nheader and all focusable elements in the accordion should be included in the\npage `Tab` sequence. `Enter` or `Space` expand and collapse each accordion\npanel.\n\nWhen an accordion panel is collapsed the content is hidden, therefore the ARIA\nstate `aria-expanded=\"false\"` advises users of assistive technologies that the\naccordion panel is not visible. When the accordion header is expanded the ARIA\nstate changes to `aria-expanded=\"true\"` and the accordion panel content is\ndisplayed. Each accordion header contains an ARIA label, and the header buttons\nhave an ARIA-control property set that points to the unique id of the panel it\ncontrols. When focus is on the accordion header there is a prominent style\nchange to the border as well as background of the accordion header.\n\n## Accessibility considerations\n\nThis component has been validated to meet the\n[WCAG 2.0 AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/) and\n[Section 508](http://www.section508.gov/) accessibility guidelines, however\nchanges made by the content owner can affect accessibility compliance. Be sure\nto review and follow the guidance in this section when updating or adding new\ncontent to this component.\n\n1. Each accordion header must have a unique title (implemented via the label for\n   the button) that clearly describes the accordion panel content. This is\n   particularly helpful for users of assistive technologies so they have the\n   necessary information to efficiently navigate the content without having to\n   expand every section.\n1. Carbon components should be used to create the content that displays within\n   each accordion panel.\n1. Avoid keyboard traps when adding components to the accordion panel. For\n   example, the user expands an accordion, but is unable to tab to the next\n   focusable element.\n1. Although the accordion component passes accessibility testing, content\n   authors need to ensure the content that is added to the accordion is\n   accessible. For example, if you add an image to the accordion header or panel\n   you need to include alternative text to pass accessibility testing.\n\n## Resources\n\n- [W3C WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices Accordion Design Pattern](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#accordion)\n  covers the usage of ARIA names, state and roles, as well as the expected\n  keyboard interactions.\n- [IBM Accessibility Checklist Checkpoint:](https://www.ibm.com/able/guidelines/ci162/accessibility_checklist.html)\n  - [1.3.1 Info and Relationships](https://www.ibm.com/able/guidelines/ci162/info_and_relationships.html)\n    (WCAG Success Criteria\n    [1.3.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/info-and-relationships))\n  - [1.3.2 Meaningful Sequence](https://www.ibm.com/able/guidelines/ci162/meaningful_sequence.html)\n    (WCAG Success Criteria\n    [1.3.2](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/meaningful-sequence))\n  - [2.1.1 Keyboard](https://www.ibm.com/able/guidelines/ci162/keyboard.html)\n    (WCAG Success Criteria\n    [2.1.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/keyboard))\n  - [2.1.2 No Keyboard Trap](https://www.ibm.com/able/guidelines/ci162/no_keyboard_trap.html)\n    (WCAG Success Criteria\n    [2.1.2](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/no-keyboard-trap))\n  - [2.4.3 Focus Order](https://www.ibm.com/able/guidelines/ci162/focus_order.html)\n    (WCAG Success Criteria\n    [2.4.3](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/focus-order))\n  - [2.4.6 Headings and Labels](https://www.ibm.com/able/guidelines/ci162/headings_and_labels.html)\n    (WCAG Success Criteria\n    [2.4.6](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/headings-and-labels))\n  - [2.4.7 Focus Visible](https://www.ibm.com/able/guidelines/ci162/focus_visible.html)\n    (WCAG Success Criteria\n    [2.4.7](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/focus-visible))\n  - [4.1.2 Name, Role, Value](https://www.ibm.com/able/guidelines/ci162/name_role_value.html)\n    (WCAG Success Criteria\n    [4.1.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/ensure-compat-rsv.html))\n\n## Accessibility testing\n\nAccessibility issues are tracked in the\n[Carbon Component GitHub repository](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/milestones).\n\n### Automated test\n\n<Row>\n  <Column noGutterSm>\n    <StructuredListWrapper>\n      <StructuredListHead>\n        <StructuredListRow head>\n          <StructuredListCell head>\n            Automated test environment\n          </StructuredListCell>\n          <StructuredListCell head>Results</StructuredListCell>\n        </StructuredListRow>\n      </StructuredListHead>\n      <StructuredListBody>\n        <StructuredListRow>\n          <StructuredListCell>\n            - macOS Mojave version 10.14.2 with VoiceOver\n            <br />\n            - Chrome version 77.0.3865.90\n            <br />\n            - Dynamic Assessment Plugin (DAP) version 1.8.0.0 - IBM\n            Accessibility WCAG 2.1 Sept. 2019 Ruleset\n            <br />- Carbon React version 7.7.1\n          </StructuredListCell>\n          <StructuredListCell>\n            <strong>DAP test:</strong>\n            <br />- Violations\n          </StructuredListCell>\n        </StructuredListRow>\n      </StructuredListBody>\n    </StructuredListWrapper>\n  </Column>\n</Row>\n\n### macOS screen reader tests\n\n<Row>\n  <Column noGutterSm>\n    <StructuredListWrapper>\n      <StructuredListHead>\n        <StructuredListRow head>\n          <StructuredListCell head>Environment </StructuredListCell>\n          <StructuredListCell head>Results</StructuredListCell>\n        </StructuredListRow>\n      </StructuredListHead>\n      <StructuredListBody>\n        <StructuredListRow>\n          <StructuredListCell>\n            - macOS Mojave version 10.14.6 with VoiceOver\n            <br />\n            - Chrome version 77.0.3865.90\n            <br />- Carbon React version 7.7.1\n          </StructuredListCell>\n          <StructuredListCell>\n            <strong>VoiceOver(VO) Test:</strong>\n            <OrderedList>\n              <ListItem>\n                The Tab key and Shift-Tab navigate between accordion headers.

Each accordion header contains an ARIA label, and the header buttons\nhave an ARIA-control property set that points to the unique id of the panel it\ncontrols. When focus is on the accordion header there is a prominent style\nchange to the border as well as background of the accordion header.\n\n## Accessibility considerations\n\nThis component has been validated to meet the\n[WCAG 2.0 AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/) and\n[Section 508](http://www.section508.gov/) accessibility guidelines, however\nchanges made by the content owner can affect accessibility compliance. Be sure\nto review and follow the guidance in this section when updating or adding new\ncontent to this component.\n\n1. Each accordion header must have a unique title (implemented via the label for\n   the button) that clearly describes the accordion panel content. This is\n   particularly helpful for users of assistive technologies so they have the\n   necessary information to efficiently navigate the content without having to\n   expand every section.\n1. Carbon components should be used to create the content that displays within\n   each accordion panel.\n1. Avoid keyboard traps when adding components to the accordion panel. For\n   example, the user expands an accordion, but is unable to tab to the next\n   focusable element.\n1. Although the accordion component passes accessibility testing, content\n   authors need to ensure the content that is added to the accordion is\n   accessible. For example, if you add an image to the accordion header or panel\n   you need to include alternative text to pass accessibility testing.\n\n## Resources\n\n- [W3C WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices Accordion Design Pattern](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#accordion)\n  covers the usage of ARIA names, state and roles, as well as the expected\n  keyboard interactions.\n- [IBM Accessibility Checklist Checkpoint:](https://www.ibm.com/able/guidelines/ci162/accessibility_checklist.html)\n  - [1.3.1 Info and Relationships](https://www.ibm.com/able/guidelines/ci162/info_and_relationships.html)\n    (WCAG Success Criteria\n    [1.3.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/info-and-relationships))\n  - [1.3.2 Meaningful Sequence](https://www.ibm.com/able/guidelines/ci162/meaningful_sequence.html)\n    (WCAG Success Criteria\n    [1.3.2](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/meaningful-sequence))\n  - [2.1.1 Keyboard](https://www.ibm.com/able/guidelines/ci162/keyboard.html)\n    (WCAG Success Criteria\n    [2.1.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/keyboard))\n  - [2.1.2 No Keyboard Trap](https://www.ibm.com/able/guidelines/ci162/no_keyboard_trap.html)\n    (WCAG Success Criteria\n    [2.1.2](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/no-keyboard-trap))\n  - [2.4.3 Focus Order](https://www.ibm.com/able/guidelines/ci162/focus_order.html)\n    (WCAG Success Criteria\n    [2.4.3](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/focus-order))\n  - [2.4.6 Headings and Labels](https://www.ibm.com/able/guidelines/ci162/headings_and_labels.html)\n    (WCAG Success Criteria\n    [2.4.6](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/headings-and-labels))\n  - [2.4.7 Focus Visible](https://www.ibm.com/able/guidelines/ci162/focus_visible.html)\n    (WCAG Success Criteria\n    [2.4.7](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/focus-visible))\n  - [4.1.2 Name, Role, Value](https://www.ibm.com/able/guidelines/ci162/name_role_value.html)\n    (WCAG Success Criteria\n    [4.1.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/ensure-compat-rsv.html))\n\n## Accessibility testing\n\nAccessibility issues are tracked in the\n[Carbon Component GitHub repository](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/milestones).\n\n### Automated test\n\n<Row>\n  <Column noGutterSm>\n    <StructuredListWrapper>\n      <StructuredListHead>\n        <StructuredListRow head>\n          <StructuredListCell head>\n            Automated test environment\n          </StructuredListCell>\n          <StructuredListCell head>Results</StructuredListCell>\n        </StructuredListRow>\n      </StructuredListHead>\n      <StructuredListBody>\n        <StructuredListRow>\n          <StructuredListCell>\n            - macOS Mojave version 10.14.2 with VoiceOver\n            <br />\n            - Chrome version 77.0.3865.90\n            <br />\n            - Dynamic Assessment Plugin (DAP) version 1.8.0.0 - IBM\n            Accessibility WCAG 2.1 Sept. 2019 Ruleset\n            <br />- Carbon React version 7.7.1\n          </StructuredListCell>\n          <StructuredListCell>\n            <strong>DAP test:</strong>\n            <br />- Violations\n          </StructuredListCell>\n        </StructuredListRow>\n      </StructuredListBody>\n    </StructuredListWrapper>\n  </Column>\n</Row>\n\n### macOS screen reader tests\n\n<Row>\n  <Column noGutterSm>\n    <StructuredListWrapper>\n      <StructuredListHead>\n        <StructuredListRow head>\n          <StructuredListCell head>Environment </StructuredListCell>\n          <StructuredListCell head>Results</StructuredListCell>\n        </StructuredListRow>\n      </StructuredListHead>\n      <StructuredListBody>\n        <StructuredListRow>\n          <StructuredListCell>\n            - macOS Mojave version 10.14.6 with VoiceOver\n            <br />\n            - Chrome version 77.0.3865.90\n            <br />- Carbon React version 7.7.1\n          </StructuredListCell>\n          <StructuredListCell>\n            <strong>VoiceOver(VO) Test:</strong>\n            <OrderedList>\n              <ListItem>\n                The Tab key and Shift-Tab navigate between accordion headers.
