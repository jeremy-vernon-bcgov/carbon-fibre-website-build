All\nthree can be used independently, but the components were designed to work\ntogether.\n\n| Shell UI component |                                                                                                                                         |\n| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Header             | The highest level of navigation. The header can be used on its own for simple products or be used to trigger the left and right panels. |\n| Left panel         | An optional panel that is used for a product's navigation.                                                                              |\n| Right panel        | An optional panel that shows additional system level actions or content associated with a system icon in the header.                    |\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![UI shell components.](images/shell-usage-1.png)\n\n<Caption>UI shell components</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n## Anatomy\n\nThe right panel is invoked by icons on the right side of the header, and remains\nanchored to that icon. Right panels have a consistent width, span the full\nheight of the viewport, and are flush to the right edge of the viewport.\n\nNote that the switcher also lives in a right panel.\n\n![Header panel and switcher.](images/right-panel-usage-1.png)\n\n<Caption>\n  The right panel configured as an empty header panel (left) and a switcher\n  (right).\n</Caption>\n\n#### Switcher item\n\nA switcher item is anything that changes what product, offering, or property\noccupies the UI shell. Consider moments in a product when you switch from a\ncalendar to a mailbox, from Kubernetes to Catalog. These items belong in the\nswitcher.\n\n#### Switcher divider\n\nA switcher divider groups similar switcher items. You can use a divider to set\napart a parent domain, group child domains similar in hierarchy to the parent,\nand set apart additional resources. The divider should not be used to separate\nevery switcher item.\n\n### Switcher\n\nThe far right header icon is reserved for the switcher icon. The switcher icon\nand the switcher panel should only be used together.\n\n<DoDontRow>\n  <DoDont colLg={6} caption=\"Positioned the switcher to the far right.\">\n\n![Example of the switcher icon being used correctly.](images/right-panel-usage-2.png)\n\n  </DoDont>\n  <DoDont type=\"dont\" colLg={6}  caption=\"Do not position other icons to the right of the switcher.\">\n\n![The switcher icon is not positioned to the far right.](images/right-panel-usage-3.png)\n\n  </DoDont>\n</DoDontRow>\n\n<DoDontRow>\n  <DoDont type=\"dont\" colLg={6}  caption=\"Do not use another icon for the switcher.\">\n\n![The switcher not using the switcher icon.](images/right-panel-usage-4.png)\n\n  </DoDont>\n</DoDontRow>\n\n## Behavior\n\n#### Expansion\n\nRight panels always float over page content, and always remain anchored to their\nassociated icon. You can have multiple right panels, but only one can be\nexpanded at any time.\n\n#### Dismissal\n\nOnce expanded, the panel's associated icon is outlined, with its bottom border\nflowing into the panel. To dismiss the panel, a user must select an item, or\nclick or tap the header icon.\n\n#### Selected state\n\nThere is no selected state for right panel items. Even if a user is currently\nwithin one of the panel items, the item remains unselected.\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"37f30e664d06424e28d9fefbc2b22be1","counter":1812,"owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx"},"frontmatter":{"title":"UI shell right panel","description":"This right panel is part of the Carbon UI shell.
