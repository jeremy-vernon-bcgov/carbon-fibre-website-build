It is a\n  stylized version of the select component, and can be styled as needed.\n\n#### When not to use\n\n- It is best practice not to use a dropdown if there are two options to choose\n  from. In this case, use a\n  [radio button](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/radio-button/code)\n  group instead.\n- Do not nest dropdowns or use them to display overly complex information. Keep\n  option selections as straight forward as possible.\n- Consider using a\n  [select dropdown](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/select/usage)\n  if most of your experience is form-based or frequently used on mobile\n  platforms. The native select works more easily with a native form when\n  submitting data and is also easier to use on a mobile platform.\n\n## Live demo\n\n<ComponentDemo\n  components={[\n    {\n      id: 'default-dropdown',\n      label: 'Default',\n    },\n    {\n      id: 'combo-box',\n      label: 'Combo box',\n    },\n    {\n      id: 'multiselect',\n      label: 'Multiselect',\n    },\n    {\n      id: 'filter-multiselect',\n      label: 'Filterable multiselect',\n    },\n  ]}\n  scope={{ items }}>\n  <ComponentVariant\n    id=\"default-dropdown\"\n    knobs={{\n      Dropdown: ['light', 'disabled'],\n    }}\n    links={{\n      React:\n        'https://react.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/story/dropdown--default',\n      Angular:\n        'https://angular.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/story/components-dropdown--basic',\n      Vue:\n        'http://vue.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/story/components-cvdropdown--default',\n      Vanilla: 'https://the-carbon-components.netlify.com/?nav=dropdown',\n    }}>{`\n    <Dropdown\n      ariaLabel=\"Dropdown\"\n      id=\"carbon-dropdown-example\"\n      items={items}\n      label=\"Dropdown menu options\"\n      titleText=\"Dropdown title\"\n    />\n  `}</ComponentVariant>\n  <ComponentVariant\n    id=\"combo-box\"\n    knobs={{\n      ComboBox: ['light', 'disabled'],\n    }}\n    links={{\n      React:\n        'https://react.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/story/combobox--default',\n      Angular:\n        'https://angular.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/story/components-dropdown--basic',\n      Vue:\n        'http://vue.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/story/components-cvcombobox--default',\n      Vanilla: 'https://the-carbon-components.netlify.com/?nav=dropdown',\n    }}>{`\n    <ComboBox\n      ariaLabel=\"ComboBox\"\n      id=\"carbon-combobox-example\"\n      items={items}\n      label=\"Combo box menu options\"\n      titleText=\"Combo box title\"\n    />\n  `}</ComponentVariant>\n  <ComponentVariant\n    id=\"multiselect\"\n    knobs={{\n      MultiSelect: ['light', 'disabled'],\n    }}\n    links={{\n      React:\n        'https://react.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/story/multiselect--default',\n      Angular:\n        'https://angular.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/story/components-dropdown--basic',\n      Vue:\n        'http://vue.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/story/components-cvmultiselect--default',\n      Vanilla: 'https://the-carbon-components.netlify.com/?nav=dropdown',\n    }}>{`\n    <MultiSelect\n      ariaLabel=\"MultiSelect\"\n      id=\"carbon-multiselect-example\"\n      items={items}\n      label=\"Multiselect menu options\"\n      titleText=\"Multiselect title\"\n    />\n  `}</ComponentVariant>\n  <ComponentVariant\n    id=\"filter-multiselect\"\n    links={{\n      React:\n        'https://react.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/story/multiselect--filterable',\n      Angular:\n        'https://angular.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/story/components-dropdown--basic',\n      Vue:\n        'http://vue.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/story/components-cvmultiselect--user-filter-and-or-highlight',\n      Vanilla: 'https://the-carbon-components.netlify.com/?nav=dropdown',\n    }}>{`\n    <MultiSelect.Filterable\n      ariaLabel=\"Filterable MultiSelect\"\n      id=\"carbon--filterable-multiselect-example\"\n      items={items}\n      label=\"Filterable multiselect options\"\n      titleText=\"Filterable multiselect title\"\n    />\n `}</ComponentVariant>\n</ComponentDemo>\n\n## Formatting\n\n### Anatomy\n\nDropdowns are composed of four distinct sections—assistive text like labels or\nhelper text, a field, a menu, and options contained within the menu. Labels and\nhelper text are optional but can guide the user to make an informed decision\nwhen making a selection.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Dropdown anatomy](images/dropdown-usage-1.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n1. **Labels and helper text (optional):** Assistive text to help the user make a\n   selection.\n2. **Field:** Persists when the dropdown is open or closed.\n3. **Option:** A list of multiple options to select from within a menu.\n4. **Menu:** Displayed as an open state and contains a list of options to select\n   from.\n\n### Sizing\n\n#### Height\n\nThere are three dropdown height sizes: Large, medium (default), and small. Use a\nconsistent dropdown height when it is being used alongside other form components\non the same page. Supporting three different dropdown sizes gives you more\nflexibility when structuring layouts. When in doubt, use the default medium size\nheight.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Dropdown sizes](images/dropdown-usage-2.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n| Dropdown size    | Height (px/rem) | Use case                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| ---------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Large            | 48/3            | Choose this size when there is a lot of space to work with. This size is typically used in simple forms or when a dropdown is placed by itself on a page, for example as a filter. |\n| Medium (default) | 40/2.5          | This is our default size and should be used whenever possible.                                                                                                                     |\n| Small            | 32/2            | Use when space is constricted or when placing a dropdown in a form that is long and complex.                                                                                       |\n\nWhen the menu is open, each option in the menu should be the same height as the\nfield. Use a consistent size of form components on the same page. For example,\nif you are using a medium size dropdown also use the same size text inputs,\nbuttons, and so on.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Dropdown field and option size relationship](images/dropdown-usage-3.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n#### Width\n\nThere is no minimum or maximum width for a dropdown. The width can be customized\nappropriately for its context.\n\n### Placement\n\nField containers should vertically align to the grid and with other form\ncomponents on a page.\n\n<DoDontRow>\n  <DoDont caption=\"Do align field containers to the grid.\">\n\n![Do align field containers to the grid.](images/dropdown-usage-4-do.png)\n\n  </DoDont>\n  <DoDont type=\"dont\" caption=\"Do not align field input text to the grid and hang the container.\">\n\n![Do not align field input text to the grid and hang the container.](images/dropdown-usage-4-dont.png)\n\n  </DoDont>\n</DoDontRow>\n\n## Content\n\n### Main elements\n\n#### Labels\n\n- Labels inform users what to expect in the list of dropdown options.\n- Keep the label short and concise by limiting it to a single line of text.\n\n#### Helper text\n\n- Helper text is pertinent information that assists the user in choosing the\n  right selection from the dropdown menu.\n- Helper text is always available when the dropdown field is focused and appears\n  underneath the label.\n- Use sentence-style capitalization and write the text as full sentences with\n  punctuation, unless space is limited.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Dropdown assistive labels, helper text or none.](images/dropdown-usage-5.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n#### Field placeholder text\n\n- Placeholder text is presented in the field by default if no selection has been\n  made from the dropdown. This is important to have in case the dropdown does\n  not have a label above it.\n- Use clear placeholder text for the dropdown trigger so that users understand\n  the purpose.\n\n#### Options in a menu\n\n- Describe the dropdown option succinctly in one line of text.\n- Never use decorative images or icons within a dropdown.\n- We recommend presenting the options in alphabetical order.\n\n### Optional versus required fields\n\nAll fields in a form are assumed required, and optional fields are tagged. For\nmore information, see the\n[form component](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/form/usage) usage\nguidance.\n\n### Overflow content\n\nAvoid having multiple lines of text in a dropdown. If the text is too long for\none line, add an ellipsis (…) for overflow content, and accompany with a\nbrowser-based tooltip to show the full string of text.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Dropdown overflow text truncation.](images/dropdown-usage-6.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n### Further guidance\n\nFor further content guidance, see Carbon's\n[content guidelines](/guidelines/content/overview).\n\n## Universal behaviors\n\nThe behaviors listed in this section are universal across all of the types. For\nbehaviors that are unique to each type, see the sections below.\n\n### Direction\n\nA dropdown can open up or down depending on its position on the screen. For\nexample, if the dropdown appears at the bottom and close to the edge of the\ninterface, the menu expands upward to avoid being cropped. By default, our\ndropdowns open downward.\n\n### Elevation\n\nCarbon has one layer style called a `box-shadow`. The box-shadow is placed\nbehind the dropdown menu when open. Box-shadow is also used in other components\nthat have overlayed menus, such as the overflow menu and date picker calendar.\nThe SCSS for box-shadow is `0 2px 6px 0 rgba(0,0,0,.2)`.\n\n### Scrolling behavior\n\nScroll bars may not always be enabled so we recommend showing 50% of the last\noption's container height to indicate there is more to see within the menu. We\nrecommend starting a scroll at the sixth option in the menu list, but this may\nvary based on your specific use case.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Dropdown scrolling menu option cutoff.](images/dropdown-usage-7a.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n### Interactions\n\n#### Mouse\n\nUsers trigger a dropdown menu to open by clicking the chevron icon or clicking\nanywhere within the field. Users can close the menu by clicking the chevron icon\nor clicking outside of the menu. _Note: You can only open a combo box by\nclicking the chevron icon or by typing in the field._\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Dropdown closed and open state click targets.](images/dropdown-usage-8a.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n- To select an option the user can click anywhere inside an option container.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Dropdown menu option click target.](images/dropdown-usage-8b.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n- To clear all selected options from a list in a `multiselect` dropdown, click\n  the “x” icon next to the value inside the tag.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Multiselect dropdown tag clear click target.](images/dropdown-usage-8c.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n- To clear a selected value in a `combo box` or a filterable dropdown, click the\n  “x” icon to the right of the field input text.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Combo box and filterable dropdown clear click target.](images/dropdown-usage-8d.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n#### Keyboard\n\n#### Dropdown:\n\n- The dropdown field is the element that receives focus. All keyboard\n  interactions happen from this element.\n- Users can move the highlighted option to the next option by pressing the\n  `Down arrow`.\n- Users can move the highlighted option to the previous option by pressing the\n  `Up arrow`.\n- Users can open the dropdown menu by pressing `Space`, `Enter`, `Down arrow` or\n  the `Up arrow`.\n- Users can close the dropdown menu by pressing `Escape`, `Space`, or `Enter`.\n\n#### Combo box and filtering:\n\n- When typing a character: focus stays on the field while an option in the menu\n  is highlighted that best matches the typed character.\n- When typing multiple characters in rapid succession: focus stays on the field\n  while an option in the menu is highlighted that best matches the string of\n  characters typed.\n\n#### Multiple selection:\n\n- The multiselect field receives focus if none of the options are selected in\n  the menu.\n- Once an option in the dropdown menu receives focus, users can press `Enter` to\n  select or deselect the option.\n- Users can open and close a dropdown menu by pressing `Space`.\n\n#### Screen readers\n\n- Labels must be announced to the screen reader on focus. Ensure the helper text\n  that appears under an input is read when an assistive technology user stops at\n  an input using ARIA.\n- VoiceOver: Users can trigger a state change by pressing `Control-Option-Space`\n  or `Space` while the dropdown field has screen reader focus.\n- JAWS: Users can trigger a state change by pressing `Space` while the dropdown\n  field has screen reader focus.\n- NVDA: Users can trigger a state change by pressing `Space` while the dropdown\n  field has screen reader focus.\n\n## Dropdown\n\nUse when you can select only one option from a list at a time.\n\n- By default, the dropdown displays placeholder text in the field when closed.\n- Clicking on a closed field opens a menu of options.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Dropdown closed and open state.](images/dropdown-usage-9a.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n- Selecting an option from the menu closes it and the selected option text\n  replaces the placeholder text in the field and also remains as an option in\n  place if the menu is open.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Dropdown selected state.](images/dropdown-usage-9b.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n## Multiselect\n\nUse when you can select multiple options from a list or to filter information.\n\n#### Making a selection\n\n- By default, the dropdown displays placeholder text in the field when closed.\n- Clicking a closed field opens a menu of options. Each option contains a\n  checkbox input to the left of the option text.\n- The menu stays open while options are being selected. The menu closes by\n  clicking the field or outside of the dropdown.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Multiselect dropdown closed and open states.](images/dropdown-usage-10a.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n- Once options have been selected from the menu, a tag appears to the left of\n  the text in the field containing the total number of selected options. The\n  placeholder text can change to text that better reflects what is selected.\n- Selected options shift to the top of the menu in alphanumeric order.\n- Unlike dropdown and combo box, the menu does not close once the user makes\n  selections. Because multiple selections are possible, the user needs to click\n  outside of the dropdown or on the parent element to close the menu.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Multiselect dropdown selected state.](images/dropdown-usage-10b.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n#### Clear all\n\nTo clear all selected options from a list, hover over the filterable tag and\nclick the “x” (or `close`) icon next to the value. To help with clarity, a\nbrowser tooltip appears when the user hovers over the “x” icon to indicate the\nclick action results. If you want to unselect individual options, you can do so\nby unselecting the checkbox of each option.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Multiselect dropdown clear tag interaction.](images/dropdown-usage-10c.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n#### Filtering\n\nUse filtering to narrow down a long list of options to find the option you want\nto select.\n\n- By default, the filterable multiselect dropdown displays placeholder text in\n  the field when closed.\n- When hovering over the field, a text cursor appears.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Filterable dropdown closed and open state.](images/dropdown-usage-10d.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n- The menu opens by clicking anywhere in the field and you can start typing to\n  filter the list of options. The options that start to match your entry remain\n  in the list while other existing options are temporarily removed.\n- After typing text in the field, the close (x) icon appears to the right of the\n  text in the field. This clears any text that’s been entered in the field.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Filterable dropdown typing and filtering open menu.](images/dropdown-usage-10e.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n- Once options have been selected from the menu, a tag appears to the left of\n  the text in the field containing the total number of selected options. The\n  placeholder text can change to text that better reflects what is selected.\n- Selected options shift to the top of the menu in alphanumeric order.\n- Like the default multiselect dropdown, the menu does not close once the user\n  makes selections.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Filterable dropdown selected state.](images/dropdown-usage-10f.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n## Combo box\n\nAllows the the user to make a selection from a predefined list of options and is\ntypically used when there are a large amount of options to choose from.\n\n- By default, the combo box displays placeholder text in the field when closed.\n- When hovering over the field, a text cursor appears.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Combo box closed enabled and hover states.](images/dropdown-usage-11a.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n- The menu opens by clicking anywhere in the field and you can start typing to\n  sort through the list of options. The options that start to match your entry\n  remain in the list while other existing options are temporarily removed.\n- After typing text in the field, the close (x) icon appears to the right of the\n  text in the field. This clears any text that’s been entered in the field.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Combo box typing and option hover jumping to matched entry in the menu.](images/dropdown-usage-11b.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n- Selecting an option closes the menu and the selected option replaces the\n  placeholder text.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Combo box selected state.](images/dropdown-usage-11c.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n## Modifiers\n\n#### Inline\n\nWhen placing a dropdown inline with other content use the inline modifier. If\nadding a visual label to an inline dropdown it should appear inline to the left\nof the dropdown. If there is no visual label present you must supply an\nappropriate accessibility label to the inline dropdown. _Note: Inline is only a\nmodifier for dropdown and does not have filtering functionality._\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Inline dropdown with label in a dashboard.](images/dropdown-usage-12.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n#### Light\n\nUse the `light` prop modifier when using a dropdown on a background other than\nthe UI background for that theme. The light prop changes the background color\ntoken of the dropdown from `field-01` to `field-02`. This is frequently used in\nform modals and side panels, or when a dropdown sits on top of a tile on a page.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Light prop applied to dropdowns in a filter panel.](images/dropdown-usage-13.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n#### Invalid\n\nReal time validation helps to streamline the process of filling out a form. We\nhave three indicators of an invalid state: a border, an icon indicator, and an\nerror message. Having text, color, and weight differentiation as invalid\nindicators help meet accessibility requirements. For full guidelines, refer to\nthe [form component](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/form/usage)\nusage page.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Dropdown invalid state.](images/dropdown-usage-14.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n#### Disabled\n\nA dropdown cannot be clicked, selected, or interacted with if it is disabled. It\nis not read by a screen reader and takes on the default disabled visual style.\nTooltips on a disabled state are also not read by screen readers and we\nrecommend having an alternative way to show descriptive text if needed.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Dropdown disabled state.](images/dropdown-usage-15.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n## Related\n\n#### Dropdown versus Select\n\nDropdown and select components have functionality and style differences.\n\n- The underlying code of a dropdown component is styled to match the design\n  system, while the select component’s appearance is determined by the browser\n  being used.\n- Use a dropdown component in forms, to select multiple options at a time and to\n  filter or sort content on a page. The select dropdown does not have filtering\n  or multiselect functionality.\n- Use a select dropdown component if most of your experience is form based.\n  Custom dropdowns can be used in these situations, but the native select works\n  more easily with a native form when submitting data.\n- Use a select dropdown component if your experience will be frequently used on\n  mobile. The native select dropdown uses the native control for the platform\n  which makes it easier to use.\n\n#### Dropdown versus Combo box\n\nWhile the dropdown and combo box look similar they have different functions.\n\n- With a dropdown list, the selected option is always visible, and the other\n  options are visible by clicking and opening the list.\n- A combo box is a combination of a standard list box or a dropdown list and an\n  editable text box and users are able to enter a value that isn't in the list.\n\n## References\n\nAngie Li,\n[Dropdown: Design Guidelines](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/drop-down-menus/)\n(Nielsen Norman Group, 2017)\n\n- [Checkbox](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/checkbox/code)\n- [Form](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/form/code)\n- [Radio button](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/radio-button/code)\n- [Select](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/select/code)\n\n## Feedback\n\nHelp us improve this pattern by providing feedback, asking questions, and\nleaving any other comments on\n[GitHub](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feedback&template=feedback.md).\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"e5fd8eb60332272199f026abf4d972d9","counter":1774,"owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Dropdown","description":"Dropdowns present a list of options from which a user can select one option, or several.

It is a\n  stylized version of the select component, and can be styled as needed.\n\n#### When not to use\n\n- It is best practice not to use a dropdown if there are two options to choose\n  from. In this case, use a\n  [radio button](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/radio-button/code)\n  group instead.\n- Do not nest dropdowns or use them to display overly complex information. Keep\n  option selections as straight forward as possible.\n- Consider using a\n  [select dropdown](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/select/usage)\n  if most of your experience is form-based or frequently used on mobile\n  platforms. The native select works more easily with a native form when\n  submitting data and is also easier to use on a mobile platform.\n\n## Live demo\n\n<ComponentDemo\n  components={[\n    {\n      id: 'default-dropdown',\n      label: 'Default',\n    },\n    {\n      id: 'combo-box',\n      label: 'Combo box',\n    },\n    {\n      id: 'multiselect',\n      label: 'Multiselect',\n    },\n    {\n      id: 'filter-multiselect',\n      label: 'Filterable multiselect',\n    },\n  ]}\n  scope={{ items }}>\n  <ComponentVariant\n    id=\"default-dropdown\"\n    knobs={{\n      Dropdown: ['light', 'disabled'],\n    }}\n    links={{\n      React:\n        'https://react.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/story/dropdown--default',\n      Angular:\n        'https://angular.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/story/components-dropdown--basic',\n      Vue:\n        'http://vue.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/story/components-cvdropdown--default',\n      Vanilla: 'https://the-carbon-components.netlify.com/?nav=dropdown',\n    }}>{`\n    <Dropdown\n      ariaLabel=\"Dropdown\"\n      id=\"carbon-dropdown-example\"\n      items={items}\n      label=\"Dropdown menu options\"\n      titleText=\"Dropdown title\"\n    />\n  `}</ComponentVariant>\n  <ComponentVariant\n    id=\"combo-box\"\n    knobs={{\n      ComboBox: ['light', 'disabled'],\n    }}\n    links={{\n      React:\n        'https://react.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/story/combobox--default',\n      Angular:\n        'https://angular.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/story/components-dropdown--basic',\n      Vue:\n        'http://vue.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/story/components-cvcombobox--default',\n      Vanilla: 'https://the-carbon-components.netlify.com/?nav=dropdown',\n    }}>{`\n    <ComboBox\n      ariaLabel=\"ComboBox\"\n      id=\"carbon-combobox-example\"\n      items={items}\n      label=\"Combo box menu options\"\n      titleText=\"Combo box title\"\n    />\n  `}</ComponentVariant>\n  <ComponentVariant\n    id=\"multiselect\"\n    knobs={{\n      MultiSelect: ['light', 'disabled'],\n    }}\n    links={{\n      React:\n        'https://react.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/story/multiselect--default',\n      Angular:\n        'https://angular.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/story/components-dropdown--basic',\n      Vue:\n        'http://vue.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/story/components-cvmultiselect--default',\n      Vanilla: 'https://the-carbon-components.netlify.com/?nav=dropdown',\n    }}>{`\n    <MultiSelect\n      ariaLabel=\"MultiSelect\"\n      id=\"carbon-multiselect-example\"\n      items={items}\n      label=\"Multiselect menu options\"\n      titleText=\"Multiselect title\"\n    />\n  `}</ComponentVariant>\n  <ComponentVariant\n    id=\"filter-multiselect\"\n    links={{\n      React:\n        'https://react.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/story/multiselect--filterable',\n      Angular:\n        'https://angular.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/story/components-dropdown--basic',\n      Vue:\n        'http://vue.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/story/components-cvmultiselect--user-filter-and-or-highlight',\n      Vanilla: 'https://the-carbon-components.netlify.com/?nav=dropdown',\n    }}>{`\n    <MultiSelect.Filterable\n      ariaLabel=\"Filterable MultiSelect\"\n      id=\"carbon--filterable-multiselect-example\"\n      items={items}\n      label=\"Filterable multiselect options\"\n      titleText=\"Filterable multiselect title\"\n    />\n `}</ComponentVariant>\n</ComponentDemo>\n\n## Formatting\n\n### Anatomy\n\nDropdowns are composed of four distinct sections—assistive text like labels or\nhelper text, a field, a menu, and options contained within the menu. Labels and\nhelper text are optional but can guide the user to make an informed decision\nwhen making a selection.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Dropdown anatomy](images/dropdown-usage-1.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n1. **Labels and helper text (optional):** Assistive text to help the user make a\n   selection.\n2. **Field:** Persists when the dropdown is open or closed.\n3. **Option:** A list of multiple options to select from within a menu.\n4. **Menu:** Displayed as an open state and contains a list of options to select\n   from.\n\n### Sizing\n\n#### Height\n\nThere are three dropdown height sizes: Large, medium (default), and small. Use a\nconsistent dropdown height when it is being used alongside other form components\non the same page. Supporting three different dropdown sizes gives you more\nflexibility when structuring layouts. When in doubt, use the default medium size\nheight.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Dropdown sizes](images/dropdown-usage-2.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n| Dropdown size    | Height (px/rem) | Use case                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| ---------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Large            | 48/3            | Choose this size when there is a lot of space to work with. This size is typically used in simple forms or when a dropdown is placed by itself on a page, for example as a filter. |\n| Medium (default) | 40/2.5          | This is our default size and should be used whenever possible.                                                                                                                     |\n| Small            | 32/2            | Use when space is constricted or when placing a dropdown in a form that is long and complex.                                                                                       |\n\nWhen the menu is open, each option in the menu should be the same height as the\nfield. Use a consistent size of form components on the same page. For example,\nif you are using a medium size dropdown also use the same size text inputs,\nbuttons, and so on.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Dropdown field and option size relationship](images/dropdown-usage-3.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n#### Width\n\nThere is no minimum or maximum width for a dropdown. The width can be customized\nappropriately for its context.\n\n### Placement\n\nField containers should vertically align to the grid and with other form\ncomponents on a page.\n\n<DoDontRow>\n  <DoDont caption=\"Do align field containers to the grid.\">\n\n![Do align field containers to the grid.](images/dropdown-usage-4-do.png)\n\n  </DoDont>\n  <DoDont type=\"dont\" caption=\"Do not align field input text to the grid and hang the container.\">\n\n![Do not align field input text to the grid and hang the container.](images/dropdown-usage-4-dont.png)\n\n  </DoDont>\n</DoDontRow>\n\n## Content\n\n### Main elements\n\n#### Labels\n\n- Labels inform users what to expect in the list of dropdown options.\n- Keep the label short and concise by limiting it to a single line of text.\n\n#### Helper text\n\n- Helper text is pertinent information that assists the user in choosing the\n  right selection from the dropdown menu.\n- Helper text is always available when the dropdown field is focused and appears\n  underneath the label.\n- Use sentence-style capitalization and write the text as full sentences with\n  punctuation, unless space is limited.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Dropdown assistive labels, helper text or none.](images/dropdown-usage-5.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n#### Field placeholder text\n\n- Placeholder text is presented in the field by default if no selection has been\n  made from the dropdown. This is important to have in case the dropdown does\n  not have a label above it.\n- Use clear placeholder text for the dropdown trigger so that users understand\n  the purpose.\n\n#### Options in a menu\n\n- Describe the dropdown option succinctly in one line of text.\n- Never use decorative images or icons within a dropdown.\n- We recommend presenting the options in alphabetical order.\n\n### Optional versus required fields\n\nAll fields in a form are assumed required, and optional fields are tagged. For\nmore information, see the\n[form component](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/form/usage) usage\nguidance.\n\n### Overflow content\n\nAvoid having multiple lines of text in a dropdown. If the text is too long for\none line, add an ellipsis (…) for overflow content, and accompany with a\nbrowser-based tooltip to show the full string of text.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Dropdown overflow text truncation.](images/dropdown-usage-6.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n### Further guidance\n\nFor further content guidance, see Carbon's\n[content guidelines](/guidelines/content/overview).\n\n## Universal behaviors\n\nThe behaviors listed in this section are universal across all of the types. For\nbehaviors that are unique to each type, see the sections below.\n\n### Direction\n\nA dropdown can open up or down depending on its position on the screen. For\nexample, if the dropdown appears at the bottom and close to the edge of the\ninterface, the menu expands upward to avoid being cropped. By default, our\ndropdowns open downward.\n\n### Elevation\n\nCarbon has one layer style called a `box-shadow`. The box-shadow is placed\nbehind the dropdown menu when open. Box-shadow is also used in other components\nthat have overlayed menus, such as the overflow menu and date picker calendar.\nThe SCSS for box-shadow is `0 2px 6px 0 rgba(0,0,0,.2)`.\n\n### Scrolling behavior\n\nScroll bars may not always be enabled so we recommend showing 50% of the last\noption's container height to indicate there is more to see within the menu. We\nrecommend starting a scroll at the sixth option in the menu list, but this may\nvary based on your specific use case.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Dropdown scrolling menu option cutoff.](images/dropdown-usage-7a.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n### Interactions\n\n#### Mouse\n\nUsers trigger a dropdown menu to open by clicking the chevron icon or clicking\nanywhere within the field. Users can close the menu by clicking the chevron icon\nor clicking outside of the menu. _Note: You can only open a combo box by\nclicking the chevron icon or by typing in the field._\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Dropdown closed and open state click targets.](images/dropdown-usage-8a.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n- To select an option the user can click anywhere inside an option container.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Dropdown menu option click target.](images/dropdown-usage-8b.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n- To clear all selected options from a list in a `multiselect` dropdown, click\n  the “x” icon next to the value inside the tag.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Multiselect dropdown tag clear click target.](images/dropdown-usage-8c.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n- To clear a selected value in a `combo box` or a filterable dropdown, click the\n  “x” icon to the right of the field input text.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Combo box and filterable dropdown clear click target.](images/dropdown-usage-8d.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n#### Keyboard\n\n#### Dropdown:\n\n- The dropdown field is the element that receives focus. All keyboard\n  interactions happen from this element.\n- Users can move the highlighted option to the next option by pressing the\n  `Down arrow`.\n- Users can move the highlighted option to the previous option by pressing the\n  `Up arrow`.\n- Users can open the dropdown menu by pressing `Space`, `Enter`, `Down arrow` or\n  the `Up arrow`.\n- Users can close the dropdown menu by pressing `Escape`, `Space`, or `Enter`.\n\n#### Combo box and filtering:\n\n- When typing a character: focus stays on the field while an option in the menu\n  is highlighted that best matches the typed character.\n- When typing multiple characters in rapid succession: focus stays on the field\n  while an option in the menu is highlighted that best matches the string of\n  characters typed.\n\n#### Multiple selection:\n\n- The multiselect field receives focus if none of the options are selected in\n  the menu.\n- Once an option in the dropdown menu receives focus, users can press `Enter` to\n  select or deselect the option.\n- Users can open and close a dropdown menu by pressing `Space`.\n\n#### Screen readers\n\n- Labels must be announced to the screen reader on focus. Ensure the helper text\n  that appears under an input is read when an assistive technology user stops at\n  an input using ARIA.\n- VoiceOver: Users can trigger a state change by pressing `Control-Option-Space`\n  or `Space` while the dropdown field has screen reader focus.\n- JAWS: Users can trigger a state change by pressing `Space` while the dropdown\n  field has screen reader focus.\n- NVDA: Users can trigger a state change by pressing `Space` while the dropdown\n  field has screen reader focus.\n\n## Dropdown\n\nUse when you can select only one option from a list at a time.\n\n- By default, the dropdown displays placeholder text in the field when closed.\n- Clicking on a closed field opens a menu of options.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Dropdown closed and open state.](images/dropdown-usage-9a.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n- Selecting an option from the menu closes it and the selected option text\n  replaces the placeholder text in the field and also remains as an option in\n  place if the menu is open.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Dropdown selected state.](images/dropdown-usage-9b.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n## Multiselect\n\nUse when you can select multiple options from a list or to filter information.\n\n#### Making a selection\n\n- By default, the dropdown displays placeholder text in the field when closed.\n- Clicking a closed field opens a menu of options. Each option contains a\n  checkbox input to the left of the option text.\n- The menu stays open while options are being selected. The menu closes by\n  clicking the field or outside of the dropdown.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Multiselect dropdown closed and open states.](images/dropdown-usage-10a.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n- Once options have been selected from the menu, a tag appears to the left of\n  the text in the field containing the total number of selected options. The\n  placeholder text can change to text that better reflects what is selected.\n- Selected options shift to the top of the menu in alphanumeric order.\n- Unlike dropdown and combo box, the menu does not close once the user makes\n  selections. Because multiple selections are possible, the user needs to click\n  outside of the dropdown or on the parent element to close the menu.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Multiselect dropdown selected state.](images/dropdown-usage-10b.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n#### Clear all\n\nTo clear all selected options from a list, hover over the filterable tag and\nclick the “x” (or `close`) icon next to the value. To help with clarity, a\nbrowser tooltip appears when the user hovers over the “x” icon to indicate the\nclick action results. If you want to unselect individual options, you can do so\nby unselecting the checkbox of each option.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Multiselect dropdown clear tag interaction.](images/dropdown-usage-10c.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n#### Filtering\n\nUse filtering to narrow down a long list of options to find the option you want\nto select.\n\n- By default, the filterable multiselect dropdown displays placeholder text in\n  the field when closed.\n- When hovering over the field, a text cursor appears.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Filterable dropdown closed and open state.](images/dropdown-usage-10d.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n- The menu opens by clicking anywhere in the field and you can start typing to\n  filter the list of options. The options that start to match your entry remain\n  in the list while other existing options are temporarily removed.\n- After typing text in the field, the close (x) icon appears to the right of the\n  text in the field. This clears any text that’s been entered in the field.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Filterable dropdown typing and filtering open menu.](images/dropdown-usage-10e.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n- Once options have been selected from the menu, a tag appears to the left of\n  the text in the field containing the total number of selected options. The\n  placeholder text can change to text that better reflects what is selected.\n- Selected options shift to the top of the menu in alphanumeric order.\n- Like the default multiselect dropdown, the menu does not close once the user\n  makes selections.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Filterable dropdown selected state.](images/dropdown-usage-10f.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n## Combo box\n\nAllows the the user to make a selection from a predefined list of options and is\ntypically used when there are a large amount of options to choose from.\n\n- By default, the combo box displays placeholder text in the field when closed.\n- When hovering over the field, a text cursor appears.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Combo box closed enabled and hover states.](images/dropdown-usage-11a.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n- The menu opens by clicking anywhere in the field and you can start typing to\n  sort through the list of options. The options that start to match your entry\n  remain in the list while other existing options are temporarily removed.\n- After typing text in the field, the close (x) icon appears to the right of the\n  text in the field. This clears any text that’s been entered in the field.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Combo box typing and option hover jumping to matched entry in the menu.](images/dropdown-usage-11b.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n- Selecting an option closes the menu and the selected option replaces the\n  placeholder text.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Combo box selected state.](images/dropdown-usage-11c.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n## Modifiers\n\n#### Inline\n\nWhen placing a dropdown inline with other content use the inline modifier. If\nadding a visual label to an inline dropdown it should appear inline to the left\nof the dropdown. If there is no visual label present you must supply an\nappropriate accessibility label to the inline dropdown. _Note: Inline is only a\nmodifier for dropdown and does not have filtering functionality._\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Inline dropdown with label in a dashboard.](images/dropdown-usage-12.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n#### Light\n\nUse the `light` prop modifier when using a dropdown on a background other than\nthe UI background for that theme. The light prop changes the background color\ntoken of the dropdown from `field-01` to `field-02`. This is frequently used in\nform modals and side panels, or when a dropdown sits on top of a tile on a page.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Light prop applied to dropdowns in a filter panel.](images/dropdown-usage-13.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n#### Invalid\n\nReal time validation helps to streamline the process of filling out a form. We\nhave three indicators of an invalid state: a border, an icon indicator, and an\nerror message. Having text, color, and weight differentiation as invalid\nindicators help meet accessibility requirements. For full guidelines, refer to\nthe [form component](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/form/usage)\nusage page.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Dropdown invalid state.](images/dropdown-usage-14.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n#### Disabled\n\nA dropdown cannot be clicked, selected, or interacted with if it is disabled. It\nis not read by a screen reader and takes on the default disabled visual style.\nTooltips on a disabled state are also not read by screen readers and we\nrecommend having an alternative way to show descriptive text if needed.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Dropdown disabled state.](images/dropdown-usage-15.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n## Related\n\n#### Dropdown versus Select\n\nDropdown and select components have functionality and style differences.\n\n- The underlying code of a dropdown component is styled to match the design\n  system, while the select component’s appearance is determined by the browser\n  being used.\n- Use a dropdown component in forms, to select multiple options at a time and to\n  filter or sort content on a page. The select dropdown does not have filtering\n  or multiselect functionality.\n- Use a select dropdown component if most of your experience is form based.\n  Custom dropdowns can be used in these situations, but the native select works\n  more easily with a native form when submitting data.\n- Use a select dropdown component if your experience will be frequently used on\n  mobile. The native select dropdown uses the native control for the platform\n  which makes it easier to use.\n\n#### Dropdown versus Combo box\n\nWhile the dropdown and combo box look similar they have different functions.\n\n- With a dropdown list, the selected option is always visible, and the other\n  options are visible by clicking and opening the list.\n- A combo box is a combination of a standard list box or a dropdown list and an\n  editable text box and users are able to enter a value that isn't in the list.\n\n## References\n\nAngie Li,\n[Dropdown: Design Guidelines](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/drop-down-menus/)\n(Nielsen Norman Group, 2017)\n\n- [Checkbox](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/checkbox/code)\n- [Form](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/form/code)\n- [Radio button](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/radio-button/code)\n- [Select](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/select/code)\n\n## Feedback\n\nHelp us improve this pattern by providing feedback, asking questions, and\nleaving any other comments on\n[GitHub](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feedback&template=feedback.md).\n","fileAbsolutePath":"/Users/jvernon/Documents/Design System/carbon/carbon-website/src/pages/components/dropdown/usage.mdx"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1364590287","2102389209","2102389209","2456312558","2746626797","2746626797","3018647132","3018647132","3037994772","3037994772","63531786","63531786","768070550"]}
