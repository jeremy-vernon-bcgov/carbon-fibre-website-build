After the tooltip opens, initial focus should be set on the first focusable\n   element in the tooltip. See WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices\n   [Modal Dialog Example, Accessibility Features section](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/examples/dialog-modal/dialog.html)\n   for best practices on setting focus. Note: This does not apply to the tooltip\n   icon or tooltip defintion components.\n2. After the tooltip closes, focus should retain the user's point of regard and\n   return to the element that invoked it. Note: This does not apply to the\n   tooltip icon or tooltip defintion components where focus never leaves the\n   element that invokes it.\n3. The tooltip component's focus must not move outside the modal until it is\n   closed. Note: This does not apply to the tooltip icon or tooltip defintion\n   components, as noted above, focus never leaves the element that invokes it.\n4.
