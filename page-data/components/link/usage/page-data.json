They provide a lightweight option for navigation but like other\ninteractive elements, too many links will clutter a page and make it difficult\nfor users to identify their next steps. This is especially true for inline\nlinks, which should be used sparingly.\n\n### When to use\n\nUse links when you want users to:\n\n- Navigate to a different page within the application\n- Navigate to an entirely different site\n- Jump to an element on the same page\n- Link to emails or phone numbers\n\n### When not to use\n\nUse a button instead of a link for actions that will change data or manipulate\nhow it is displayed, change a state, or trigger an action. Buttons should never\nbe used for navigational actions.\n\n### Types\n\n| Type                           | Usage                                                                                                                                                            |\n| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| [Standalone](#standalone-link) | These links are the default link type.

Because links take users to a new\nlocation, it is important that their labels accurately reflect the content users\nwill find at the link destination. Use meaningful labels for links and avoid\nterms like \"click here\" or the web address itself.\n\nLinks need to be clear enough to be understood by the user, but should not be so\nlong that the text wraps unless used inline.\n\nFor further content guidance, see IBM Accessibility on\n[link purpose](https://www.ibm.com/able/guidelines/ci162/link_purpose.html).\n\n## Behaviors\n\n### Interactions\n\n#### Mouse\n\nUsers can open a link by clicking anywhere along the link text or on the\nassociated icon.\n\n#### Keyboard\n\nUsers can open a link by pressing `Enter` while the link has focus. For\nadditional keyboard interactions, see the Accessibility tab.\n\n#### Screen readers\n\nVoiceOver: Users can open a link by pressing `Control-Option-Space` or `Enter`.\n\nJAWS: Users can open a link by pressing `Enter`.\n\nNVDA: Users can open a link by pressing `Enter`.\n\nFor additional information, see\n[screen reader tests](accessibility/#macos-screen-reader-tests).\n\n## Link types\n\n### Standalone link\n\nStandalone links are used on their own directly following content. They should\nnot be used within sentences or paragraphs. Standalone links are the default\nlink style for Carbon and only have an underline in the hover state.\n\nThe standalone link component can be paired with an icon. Use 16px icons and\nplace them to the right of the link. Icons should always be the same color as\nthe link text.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![link with icon example](images/02_link_icon_608.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n### Inline link\n\nInline links are used in sentences or paragraphs of text. The inline link\nbehaves the same as the standalone link but it is styled with an underline. This\nhelps differentiate them from the text they are placed next to and makes it\nclear users can interact with them.\n\nInline links should not be used on their own and should not be paired with\nicons.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![inline link example](images/03_link_inline_608.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n## Modifiers\n\n### Visited style\n\nBy default, the link component does not use a visited style. Visited links\nindicate that a user has already opened the link so they can be a helpful\nindicator during task completion. Visited styles should be used sparingly\nbecause they often clutter the the page and add further visual noise as users\nare trying to navigate a product. They can be used if it is important that a\nuser knows they have already clicked on a link.\n\n### Links that trigger actions\n\nSome links trigger actions to aid task completion in addition to navigation.\nThese links should still serve a navigation purpose. A common example is linking\nphone numbers so clicking the website automatically opens and calls the phone\nnumber when clicked. The label and any accompanying icons should make it clear\nwhat action will be triggered and where the user will be directed.\n\n## Related\n\n- [Button component](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/button/usage/)\n\n## Feedback\n\nHelp us improve this component by providing feedback, asking questions, and\nleaving any other comments on\n[GitHub](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feedback&template=feedback.md).\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"628d34d9480ebcd6a070de54ed707788","counter":3159,"owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Link","description":"Links are used as navigational elements.
