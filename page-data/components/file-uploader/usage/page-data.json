We have an option for a single line or multi-line error state depending\non how descriptive the message needs to be. Error messages should provide clear\nguidance to help the user resolve the error.\n\nIf the error relates to the file uploader as a whole instead of an individual\nfile, you can alternatively use an inline error notification.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![File uploader invalid states](images/file-uploader-usage-8.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n## File uploader\n\nA file uploader traditionally uploads one or more files by clicking an action\nbutton that prompts a file selection dialog. Once you have selected one or more\nfiles from the dialog, the selected files will populate below the file uploader\non the page. Your file may temporarily display a loading state before uploading\nhas been successfully completed.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={12}>\n\n![File uploader in context example](images/file-uploader-usage-9.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n## Drag and drop file uploader\n\nDrag and drop file uploaders are used to directly upload files by dragging and\ndropping them into a drop zone area. Alternatively, you can also traditionally\nopen files through a file selection dialog by clicking the text link description\ninside the drop zone.\n\nThe drop zone component lets users upload files by dragging and dropping the\nfiles into an area on a page, or activating a button.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={12}>\n\n![File uploader in context example](images/file-uploader-usage-10a.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\nWhen dragging files into the drop zone area, the drop zone border changes in\ncolor and thickness to indicate the area has been activated and is ready for\nfiles. Additionally once the cursor hits the drop zone area it changes with a\npreview of the file you are about to upload. The style of cursor change is\nrendered by the browser you use.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Drag and drop file uploader in context example](images/file-uploader-usage-10b.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n## References\n\nPage Laubheimer,\n[Drag–and–Drop: How to Design for Ease of Use](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/drag-drop/),\n(Nielsen Norman Group, 2020)\n\n## Feedback\n\nHelp us improve this component by providing feedback, asking questions, and\nleaving any other comments on\n[GitHub](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feedback&template=feedback.md).\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"295f246f97861870c595e9afc039e05e","counter":1770,"owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx"},"frontmatter":{"title":"File uploader","description":"File uploaders allow users to select one or more files to upload to a specific location.","tabs":["Usage","Style","Code","Accessibility"]},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: File uploader\ndescription:\n  File uploaders allow users to select one or more files to upload to a specific\n  location.\ntabs: ['Usage', 'Style', 'Code', 'Accessibility']\n---\n\n<PageDescription>\n\nFile uploaders allow users to select one or more files to upload to a specific\nlocation.\n\n</PageDescription>\n\n<AnchorLinks>\n\n<AnchorLink>Overview</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Live demo</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Formatting</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Content</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Universal behaviors</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>File uploader</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Drag and drop file uploader</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>References</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Feedback</AnchorLink>\n\n</AnchorLinks>\n\n## Overview\n\nFile uploaders allow users to upload content of their own.

Error messages should provide clear\nguidance to help the user resolve the error.\n\nIf the error relates to the file uploader as a whole instead of an individual\nfile, you can alternatively use an inline error notification.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![File uploader invalid states](images/file-uploader-usage-8.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n## File uploader\n\nA file uploader traditionally uploads one or more files by clicking an action\nbutton that prompts a file selection dialog. Once you have selected one or more\nfiles from the dialog, the selected files will populate below the file uploader\non the page. Your file may temporarily display a loading state before uploading\nhas been successfully completed.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={12}>\n\n![File uploader in context example](images/file-uploader-usage-9.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n## Drag and drop file uploader\n\nDrag and drop file uploaders are used to directly upload files by dragging and\ndropping them into a drop zone area. Alternatively, you can also traditionally\nopen files through a file selection dialog by clicking the text link description\ninside the drop zone.\n\nThe drop zone component lets users upload files by dragging and dropping the\nfiles into an area on a page, or activating a button.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={12}>\n\n![File uploader in context example](images/file-uploader-usage-10a.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\nWhen dragging files into the drop zone area, the drop zone border changes in\ncolor and thickness to indicate the area has been activated and is ready for\nfiles. Additionally once the cursor hits the drop zone area it changes with a\npreview of the file you are about to upload. The style of cursor change is\nrendered by the browser you use.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Drag and drop file uploader in context example](images/file-uploader-usage-10b.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n## References\n\nPage Laubheimer,\n[Drag–and–Drop: How to Design for Ease of Use](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/drag-drop/),\n(Nielsen Norman Group, 2020)\n\n## Feedback\n\nHelp us improve this component by providing feedback, asking questions, and\nleaving any other comments on\n[GitHub](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feedback&template=feedback.md).\n","fileAbsolutePath":"/Users/jvernon/Documents/Design System/carbon/carbon-website/src/pages/components/file-uploader/usage.mdx"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1364590287","2102389209","2102389209","2456312558","2746626797","2746626797","3018647132","3018647132","3037994772","3037994772","63531786","63531786","768070550"]}
