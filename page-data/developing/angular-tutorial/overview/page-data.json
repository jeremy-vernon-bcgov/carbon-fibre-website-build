If you want to jump straight to code, you may want to skip this\ntutorial and go to the [developers getting started](/developing/get-started)\npage.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n### Angular\n\nThis is a web development tutorial that uses the Carbon Angular components. If\nyou're just getting started with Angular and enjoy learning-by-doing, check out\nthe official Angular [guide](https://angular.io/docs).\n\n### ES6/ES2015\n\nAngular apps often use the latest and greatest from JavaScript (ES6/ES2015).\nYou'll want to be up to speed on the most commonly used features of the\nlanguage.\n[Let's Learn ES6](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL57atfCFqj2h5fpdZD-doGEIs0NZxeJTX)\ncovers those features in depth.\n\n### GitHub\n\nWe'll be using GitHub to build an app together, so if you're new to GitHub, make\nsure you've [made an account](https://github.com/join). Their\n[getting started guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world) is a\ngreat way to learn GitHub.\n\n### npm\n\nThis tutorial uses [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) for dependency management. Make\nsure that you have [npm installed](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) prior to\nstarting the tutorial so you can follow along step-by-step.\n\n## Outline\n\nEach step in this tutorial illustrates a different aspect of developing web\napplications with Carbon. We recommend starting with step 1, but you can pick up\nany step and take it from there.\n\n1. [**Installing Carbon**](/developing/angular-tutorial/step-1)\n   - Create a web app with the UI shell component.\n1. [**Building pages**](/developing/angular-tutorial/step-2)\n   - Build out pages with the grid and various components.\n1. [**Using APIs**](/developing/angular-tutorial/step-3)\n   - Populate the data table with an external data source.\n1. [**Creating components**](/developing/angular-tutorial/step-4)\n   - Extend Carbon by creating your own components.\n1. [**Deploying to IBM Cloud**](/developing/angular-tutorial/step-5)\n   - Build and host your app in a production environment.\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"d3491a3d5b348ba4474867ecd1a86476","counter":3049,"owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Tutorial overview","tabs":["Overview","Step 1","Step 2","Step 3","Step 4","Step 5","Wrapping up"]},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Tutorial overview\ntabs:\n  ['Overview', 'Step 1', 'Step 2', 'Step 3', 'Step 4', 'Step 5', 'Wrapping up']\n---\n\nimport Preview from 'components/Preview';\n\n<PageDescription>\n\nWelcome to Carbon!
