This often makes it unclear when\nthe DOM element to instantiate a Carbon component is available, which often\ndepends on the JavaScript framework you use.\n\nAlso when DOM elements that Carbon components have been instantiated on are\nbeing destroyed, the Carbon component instances should be released so that e.g.\nthere are no zombie event handlers.\n\nThe easiest way to hook on the creation/destruction of DOM elements is by\ndefining a \"wrapping component\", with the JavaScript framework of your choice.\nHere's an example using Web Components'\n[Custom Elements v1 spec](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Custom_Elements),\nbut the notion of components, along with the lifecycle callbacks, are commonly\nfound in many other JavaScript frameworks.\n\n```javascript\nclass BXLoading extends HTMLElement {\n  // Called when this custom element gets into render tree\n  connectedCallback() {\n    // \"this\" here is \"<bx-loading>\" element\n    this.innerHTML =\n      '(e.g. snippet from http://carbondesignsystem.com/components/loading/code)';\n    this.loading = CarbonComponents.Loading.create(\n      this.querySelector('[data-loading]')\n    );\n  }\n  // Called when this custom element gets out of render tree\n  disconnectedCallback() {\n    this.loading.release();\n  }\n}\ncustomElements.define('bx-loading', BXLoading);\n```\n\n## Examples\n\n[Angular 4 wrapper for Carbon](https://codepen.io/asudoh/pen/VryJBO?editors=1010)\n(We use this just as an example.\n[Angular](https://github.com/IBM/carbon-components-angular) is now supported by\nthe Carbon Design System.)\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nIf you experience any issues while getting set up with Carbon Components, please\nhead over to the\n[Carbon Components GitHub repo](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-components)\nfor more guidelines and support. Please\n[create an issue](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues) if your\nissue does not already exist.\n\n## Other frameworks\n\nWe are open to the idea of providing core support for additional frameworks in\nfuture. We added Angular support in the summer of 2018 and Vue in early 2019.\n\nFor the Carbon Design System to incorporate additional frameworks into our core\noffering, those frameworks need clear, guaranteed, ongoing resources to maintain\nand support that option. If a team built a product using a native web components\nimplemenation of Carbon, for example, but had no plan to support that solution\noutside of their product, that couldn't become a core part of the Carbon Design\nSystem.\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"0379873e7bd3320ac6312716400b6978","counter":3045,"owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Frameworks","description":"The Carbon Design System is built React first.
