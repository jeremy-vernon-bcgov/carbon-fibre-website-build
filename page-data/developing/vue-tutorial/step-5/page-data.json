If you haven't forked and\ncloned that repository yet, and haven't added the upstream remote, go ahead and\ndo so by following the\n[step 1 instructions](/developing/vue-tutorial/step-1#fork-clone-and-branch).\n\n### Branch\n\nWith your repository all set up, let's check out the branch for this tutorial\nstep's starting point.\n\n```bash\ngit fetch upstream\ngit checkout -b vue-step-5 upstream/vue-step-5\n```\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\n**Note:** This builds on top of step 4, but be sure to check out the upstream\nstep 5 branch because it includes the static assets required to get through this\nstep.\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\n### Build and start app\n\nInstall the app's dependencies (in case you're starting fresh in your current\ndirectory and not continuing from the previous step):\n\n```bash\nyarn\n```\n\nThen, start the app:\n\n```bash\nyarn serve\n```\n\nYou should see something similar to where the\n[previous step](/developing/vue-tutorial/step-4) left off.\n\n## Create IBM Cloud account\n\nBefore we get started,\n[create an IBM Cloud account](https://cloud.ibm.com/registration) if you don't\nalready have one, as we'll be deploying there in a bit.\n\n## Optimize Sass\n\nSo far we've been developing in a, well, development environment where static\nasset optimization hasn't been a priority. If you reference\n`/src/styles/_carbon.scss`, you'll see one `@import` that is pulling in Carbon's\nfull Sass build.\n\n```scss path=src/styles/_carbon.scss\n$feature-flags: (\n  grid-columns-16: true,\n);\n\n@import 'carbon-components/scss/globals/scss/styles.scss';\n```\n\nTo give you an idea of what's all included, open up\n`node_modules/carbon-components/scss/globals/scss/styles.scss`. You'll see\nimports for components like accordion, slider, tooltip, etc. Since we aren't\nusing those components, let's exclude them from our built stylesheets. Keeping\nthe `$feature-flags` Sass map, replace the `styles.scss` import only with:\n\n```scss path=src/styles/_carbon.scss\n// Feature flags\n$css--font-face: true;\n$css--plex: true;\n\n// Global styles\n@import 'carbon-components/scss/globals/scss/css--font-face';\n@import 'carbon-components/scss/globals/grid/grid';\n\n// Carbon components\n@import 'carbon-components/scss/components/breadcrumb/breadcrumb';\n@import 'carbon-components/scss/components/button/button';\n@import 'carbon-components/scss/components/data-table/data-table';\n@import 'carbon-components/scss/components/link/link';\n@import 'carbon-components/scss/components/pagination/pagination';\n@import 'carbon-components/scss/components/tabs/tabs';\n@import 'carbon-components/scss/components/ui-shell/ui-shell';\n```\n\nIn comparing to the included `styles.scss`, you may be asking what happened to\nimporting `_vars.scss`, `_colors.scss`, `_theme.scss`, etc.? Many of those\nglobal Sass partials get imported through the components. For example, open\n`node_modules/carbon-components/scss/components/button/_button.scss` to see its\ndependencies. No harm in importing them as `styles.scss` does, but for\nsimplicity here, we'll let the components pull them in.\n\nYou can read more about optimizing Carbon's Sass in the\n[Carbon Design System publication](https://medium.com/carbondesign/minimal-css-with-carbon-b0c089ccfa71)\non Medium.\n\n## Build for production\n\nBefore we deploy our app, we need to create an optimized production build with\nthis command. You may need to `CTRL-C` to stop the development environment\nfirst.\n\n```bash\nyarn build\n```\n\nLooking at `package.json`, you'll find `yarn build` to run\n`vue-cli-service build`. This builds the app for production to the `dist`\nfolder. It bundles Vue in production mode and optimizes the build for the best\nperformance. It even goes so far to minify files and include hashes in filenames\nfor caching.\n\nAs a lot of this may seem like magic since the build configuration came from the\nVue CLI, go ahead and check out their\n[production build guidelines](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/build-targets.html#app)\nfor a full description of what's happening.\n\n## Create manifest file\n\nNow that we have a production build, let's get it on the cloud. We're going to\nuse\n[staticfile-buildpack](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/staticfile-buildpack.git)\nto deploy our webapp. We'll be using the `cf` command line interface (CLI). If\nrunning `cf --help` doesn't work for you, chances are you need to\n[install the CLI](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/install-go-cli.html).\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\n**Note:** If unfamiliar with buildpacks, the\n[staticfile buildpack docs](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/buildpacks/staticfile/index.html)\nhas good definitions and configuration documentation.\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\nWith the IBM Cloud CLI installed, next, we need to create a `manifest.yml` file\nin the root of the project. To prevent multiple apps trying to use the\n`carbon-tutorial-vue` name, replace `USERNAME` with your GitHub username below\nto make sure our apps are uniquely named.\n\n```bash path=manifest.yml\n---\napplications:\n  - name: carbon-tutorial-vue-USERNAME\n    memory: 64M\n    buildpack: https://github.com/cloudfoundry/staticfile-buildpack.git\n```\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\n**Note:** With this set-up we're still using a GitHub personal access token\nsaved in `.env.local`. If you haven't created a GitHub access token yet, see\n[step 3](/developing/vue-tutorial/step-3#create-access-token). You can put the\nenvironment variable in the manifest file, or manually add it in the IBM Cloud\ndashboard, but since we're building off previous tutorial steps nothing more is\nneeded.\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\n## Create static file\n\nCreate a new static file in the root of the project named `Staticfile`. This\ntells the app to deploy from the `dist` folder and not the root of the project.\n\n```bash path=Staticfile\nroot: dist\n```\n\n### Cloud Foundry ignore\n\nAfter telling Cloud Foundry what to include, we can also specify what to ignore.\nCreate a top-level `.cfignore` file. Cloud Foundry doesn't let you push\nread-only files (specifically, files with permissions <`400`), so to prevent\nissues with the deploy, add:\n\n```bash path=.cfignore\nnode_modules/.cache\n```\n\nYou can speed up deploys by decreasing the files uploaded through IBM Cloud. To\naccomplish this, ignore any folder not required by the production application on\nIBM Cloud. For example, in the case of serving static files, you can ignore\n`node_modules/` and `src/` because the only folder being served is `dist/`.\n\n## Deploy app\n\nLogin to IBM Cloud.\n\n```bash\ncf login -sso\n```\n\nDeploy app using the `cf push` command. Since `manifest.yml` is in our root\ndirectory, we don't need to specify it in the push command. But, if you have\nmultiple manifest files that target different environments, it's good practice\nto specify the file.\n\n_Note: To successfully deploy, you might need to update the region code (e.g.\n`api.[REGION].bluemix.net`).\n[Learn more.](https://developer.ibm.com/answers/answers/166990/view.html)_\n\n```bash\ncf push -f manifest.yml\n```\n\nTo make it easy on ourselves by not needing to remember that command, let's add\na script in `package.json`. We can combine the build and deploy steps to make\nsure we only deploy immediately after running the build. In the `\"scripts\"`\nobject in `package.json`, add:\n\n##### package.json\n\n```bash\n\"deploy\": \"rm -rf ./dist && yarn build && cf push -f manifest.yml\"\n```\n\nNext time you want to deploy, you can simply run `yarn deploy`.\n\n## Submit pull request\n\nThat does it! We're going to submit a pull request to verify completion of this\ntutorial step. In doing so, **please include the mybluemix.net URL for your\ndeployed app in your pull request description**.\n\n### Continuous integration (CI) check\n\nRun the CI check to make sure we're all set to submit a pull request.\n\n```bash\nyarn ci-check\n```\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\n**Note:** Having issues running the CI check?\n[Step 1](/developing/vue-tutorial/step-1#continuous-integration-ci-check) has\ntroubleshooting notes that may help.\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\n### Git commit and push\n\nBefore we can create a pull request, stage and commit all of your changes:\n\n```bash\ngit add --all && git commit -m \"feat(tutorial): complete step 5\"\n```\n\nThen, push to your repository:\n\n```bash\ngit push origin vue-step-5\n```\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\n**Note:** Having issues pushing your changes?\n[Step 1](/developing/vue-tutorial/step-1#git-commit-and-push) has\ntroubleshooting notes that may help.\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\n### Pull request (PR)\n\nFinally, visit\n[carbon-tutorial-vue](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-tutorial-vue)\nto \"Compare & pull request\". In doing so, make sure that you are comparing to\n`vue-step-5` into `base: vue-step-5`.\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\n**Note:** Expect your tutorial step PRs to be reviewed by the Carbon team but\nnot merged. We'll close your PR so we can keep the repository's remote branches\npristine and ready for the next person!\n\n</InlineNotification>\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"4f024f6a644cf98b2a5ed9e09fde1e56","counter":3036,"owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx"},"frontmatter":{"title":"5.
