Rectangular charts are typically\nconstructed with a set of common elements including a legend, axis titles, and\nnavigation tools like a zoom bar and tooltip.\n\n<Row>\n<Column  colLg={8} colMd={8} colSm={4}>\n<ArtDirection>\n\n![Color in UI](images/chart-anatomy-1sm.png)\n![Color in UI](images/chart-anatomy-1.png)\n![Color in UI](images/chart-anatomy-1.png)\n\n</ArtDirection>\n\n<Caption></Caption>\n</Column>\n\n<Column colLg={2} colMd={2} colSm={2} offsetLg={1}>\n  <Aside>\n    1.

Tooltip<br/>\n  </Aside>\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n#### Titles, labels, and legends\n\nThe title of a piece of visualization should be descriptive and qualitative. It\nshould also reflect the main insight the data reveals. The legend should explain\nthe chart’s meaning by defining the association of each visual property, such as\ncolor, shape, and size, to the corresponding data. When possible, use labels\ndirectly on the chart to avoid long legends. All the text should be concise and\neasy to understand. [Read more on legend usage.](../data-visualization/legends)\n\n#### Tooltips\n\nA tooltip is a message that appears when a cursor is positioned over an element,\nsuch as a data point, icon button, or truncated text. By default, tooltips show\non hover to reveal more detailed information or context for specific chart\nelements. A tooltip should repeat the corresponding values of the data point on\nboth axes and any other relevant details.\n\n#### Graph frames, axes, and ticks\n\nThe graph frame is the area where the data will be visualized as graphics or\nnumbers. Axes, ticks, and the grid should help the reader understand the\nproportions and scale of the data, the indicators involved, and their unit of\nmeasure. Avoid filling the chart frame with too many elements, as it impacts the\nuser’s ability to interpret the data.\n[Read more on axes usage.](../data-visualization/axes-and-labels)\n\n## Circular charts\n\nCircular charts are primarily pie and donut charts. Other circular layout charts\ninclude radar and solar charts.\n\n<Row>\n<Column  colLg={8} colMd={8} colSm={4}>\n<ArtDirection>\n\n![Color in UI](images/chart-anatomy-2sm.png)\n![Color in UI](images/chart-anatomy-2.png)\n![Color in UI](images/chart-anatomy-2.png)\n\n</ArtDirection>\n<Caption></Caption>\n</Column>\n\n<Column colLg={2} colMd={2} colSm={2} offsetLg={1}>\n  <Aside>\n    1.

Big number<br/>\n  </Aside>\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n#### Labels\n\nIn a circular chart, labels offer the percentage value of the whole for an\nindividual category. When the graphic translation of the data is less than 3\ndegrees, a callout is used to clearly associate the label with the slice. If the\ndata translates as less than 1 degree, a slice will not be rendered on the\nchart, the data would not be keyboard accessible or available in a tooltip\neither. The only way to see the data in this scenario would be via a data table,\na feature that we'd like to implement for all charts to enhance accessibility.\n\n#### Big number or KPI\n\nA key performance indicator (KPI) consists of a number with a single word\ndescription. Examples include “15,250 browsers”, “\\$1.3M revenue”, or “Total\n450”. A big number inside the donut chart may be used to display a total sum or\nthe individual count of a slice upon interaction. This element can also be used\nindependently on a dashboard (though please note this component is still a WIP\nand not available outside the donut chart).\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"8de25f212cba5c300f8162f0374124a4","counter":4780,"owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Chart anatomy","description":"The elements constructing each chart are designed to work in harmony.
