This is usually emphasized using a different set of colors for each\nblock.\n\n<Row>\n<Column  colLg={12} colMd={8} colSm={4} >\n\n![Alluvial diagram](images/01_adv_alluvial_928.png)\n\n<Caption>Example of alluvial diagram made with two blocks</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<Row>\n<Column  colLg={4} colMd={4} colSm={4} >\n\n![Alluvial node hover detail](images/02_adv_alluvial_detail_288.png)\n\n<Caption>Detail of an alluvial diagram on node hover</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n\n<Column  colLg={4} colMd={4} colSm={4} >\n\n![Alluvial link hover detail](images/03_adv_alluvial_288.png)\n\n<Caption>Detail of an alluvial diagram on link hover</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n## Heat maps\n\nA heat map is a two-dimensional visualization in which individual values\ncontained in a matrix are represented as colors. This technique makes it easy to\nvisualize complex data at a glance. When it comes to heat maps, the most common\ncolor ranges are expressed in either sequential and diverging color scales\naccording to the type of data represented.\n\n#### Sequential scales\n\nSequential scales use a blended progression, typically of a single color, from\nthe lowest contrast to the highest contrast values, representing lows to highs.\nIt’s best practice to use a sequential scale with values that are all positive\nor all negative. Sequential heat maps can leverage the full range of the palette\n(from 10–100) to maximize contrast. Please note that the 3:1 minimum contrast\nrequirement does not apply to heat maps.\n\n<Row>\n<Column  colLg={12} colMd={8} colSm={4} >\n\n![Sequential heat map](images/04_adv_heatmap_928.png)\n\n<Caption>\n  When cells get extremely small, a white border can hinder the intended effect.\n</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n#### Heat map behaviors\n\nAxis ticks and legend can be used to leverage the chart potential giving the\nusers additional information and dedicated kinds of interaction.\n\n<Row>\n<Column  colLg={4} colMd={4} colSm={4} >\n\n![Heat map hover detail](images/04a_adv_heatmap_detail_288.png)\n\n<Caption>Exploration of a domain axis hover behavior</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n\n<Column  colLg={4} colMd={4} colSm={4} >\n\n![Heat map interactive legend detail](images/04b_adv_heatmap_detail_288.png)\n\n<Caption>Exploration of an interactive legend</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n#### Divergent scales\n\nDiverging scales show color progression in two directions: dialing down the\ncontrast of the first hue from one end to a neutral color at the midpoint, then\nincreasing the contrast of the second hue to the other end of the scale. The\nneutral midpoint is often referred to as the \"inflection point\" (for example, a\n0 value midway between -100 and +100).\n\n[Divergent scales](../data-visualization/color-palettes#diverging-palettes)\nrequire three colors for their correspondent values (min, max, and inflection point)\nand Carbon has provided two approved palettes for divergent visualizations.\nAlthough the examples here use the \"discrete\" (stepped scale) provided by the\nCarbon palette, divergent heat maps often leverage \"continuous\" values\n(gradients) to accommodate situations that require more than 10 values.\n\n#### Inflection points\n\nWhile min/max values can be automatically detected from data, inflection points\ncan vary depending on data type. We default to zero in order to accommodate the\nmost common cases and include a feature flag within the code to specify\nexceptions. The data for a divergent heat map does not need to be symmetrical on\neither side of the inflection point. For example, the data set could have a zero\nvalue between -20 and +100 as well.\n\n<Row>\n<Column  colLg={12} colMd={8} colSm={4} >\n\n![Divergent heat map](images/05_adv_heatmap_928.png)\n\n<Caption>\n  Example of a symmetrical divergent heat map with optional cell borders\n</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n## Network diagrams\n\nA network diagram is a way of visually representing network architecture. It\nmaps out network structure with a variety of icons and connecting lines. It’s\nideal for sharing the layout of a network because the visual presentation makes\nit easier for users to understand complex connections at a glance. These\ndiagrams are especially useful for isolating problems or when designing a new\nsystem.\n\nThe example below illustrates a swimlane graph with expandable nodes developed\nby the Security team. In products like QRadar these diagrams are often paired\nwith side and filter panels. However, a simplified version of the component is\navailable in the\n[Carbon-charts repository](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-charts/pull/435)\nfor IBM designers to adapt.\n\n<Row>\n<Column  colLg={12} colMd={8} colSm={4} >\n\n![Network diagram swimlane graph, organic view](images/06_adv_tree_928.png)\n\n<Caption>Example of a network diagram in a swimlane graph from QRadar</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n### Node types\n\nThis specific network diagram is comprised of parent and child nodes. In the\nQRadar example, parent nodes convey the story of what happened in an\ninvestigation and can be clustered based on relationship type. Child nodes\nappear under parent nodes and can also be clustered.\n\nNetwork diagrams use the same scale controls that apply to the rest of the data\nvisualization components, however they appear in a floating tile, enabling the\nuser to zoom and pan simultaneously. It’s also helpful to include the expand and\ncollapse all nodes feature, which gives users the ability to easily navigate\nbetween detailed and high-level views of the diagram.\n\n<Row>\n<Column  colLg={4} colMd={4} colSm={4} >\n\n![Floating zoom and pan detail](images/07_adv_tree_detail_288.png)\n\n<Caption>Detail of floating zoom and pan functionality</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n\n<Column  colLg={4} colMd={4} colSm={4} >\n\n![Child nodes detail](images/08_adv_tree_detail_288.png)\n\n<Caption>\n  Detail of child nodes clustered underneath master parent cluster\n</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n## Parallel coordinates\n\nParallel coordinate charts visualize individual data elements across multiple\nvariables. Each variable corresponds to a vertical axis and each data element is\ndisplayed as a series of connected points along the axes.\n\nThe parallel coordinate chart is the equivalent of a radar chart with axes —\nmaking it preferable for many use cases. Its strength is that each variable can\nbe completely different and even have its own scale (the units can even be\ndifferent).\n\n<Row>\n<Column  colLg={12} colMd={8} colSm={4} >\n\n![Parallel coordinate plot](images/new_adv_parallel_928.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n### Parallel coordinate behaviors\n\nHover effects that highlight a specific group or axis can be added to enhance\nbasic parallel coordinate charts. These charts can also include interactive\nfeatures like the brush component. By clicking and dragging along any axis, you\ncan specify a filter for that dimension. The brush component is also used in the\nupdated scatterplot matrix example. See the detail below.\n\n<Row>\n<Column  colLg={4} colMd={4} colSm={4} >\n\n![Brush component detail](images/new_adv_parallel_detail_01_288.png)\n\n<Caption>Detail of brush component behavior</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n\n<Column  colLg={4} colMd={4} colSm={4} >\n\n![Tooltip detail](images/new_adv_parallel_detail_02_288.png)\n\n<Caption>Detail of a comparative tooltip interaction on hover</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n## Tree maps\n\nTree maps can work for visualizing a part-to-whole relationship among a large\nnumber of categories—as long as the data is hierarchical and exact comparisons\nbetween the categories is not a primary concern.\n\nWhen dealing with large amounts of data in a constrained space, tree structured\nnodelink diagrams (like the network diagram shown above), grow too complex to be\nuseful. Tree maps provide an attractive alternative by maintaining a\nhierarchical structure while displaying rectangular quantities for each category\nand subcategory via area size.\n\n<Row>\n<Column  colLg={12} colMd={8} colSm={4} >\n\n![Basic tree map](images/new_adv_treemap_01_928.png)\n\n<Caption>\n  Example of a basic tree map where countries are colored according to the\n  continent they belong to\n</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n#### Divergent tree maps\n\nDivergent tree maps combine Carbon's divergent color palette with the\nhierarchical structure of a tree map. Each rectangle has an area proportional to\na specified dimension of the data, but the rectangles can also be colored\nindependently according to an additional indicator.\n\nAs with [heat maps](../data-visualization/advanced-charts#heat-maps), the\ndiverging palette shows color progression in either direction from an inflection\npoint (for example, a 0 value midway between -10 and +10). In the example below,\nthe inflection point is simply an average. Tourism can be mapped by the number\nof visitors to a certain country, but the visualization can also compare this\ndata to a yearly average. For instance, even though one country may have a lot\nof visitors compared to another country, tourism for that country may fall below\nits annual average.\n\n<Row>\n<Column  colLg={12} colMd={8} colSm={4} >\n\n![Basic tree map](images/new_adv_treemap_02_928.png)\n\n<Caption>\n  Example of a divergent tree map adding color as a second variable to a basic\n  tree map structure\n</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<Row>\n<Column  colLg={4} colMd={4} colSm={4} >\n\n![Basic treemap tooltip detail](images/new_adv_treemap_a_288.png)\n\n<Caption>Detail of a tooltip on a basic treemap</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n\n<Column  colLg={4} colMd={4} colSm={4} >\n\n![Tooltip detail](images/new_adv_treemap_b_288.png)\n\n<Caption>Detail of a comparative tooltip on a divergent tree map</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n## Geospatial charts\n\n### Geographic overlays\n\n#### Choropleth map\n\nA map that uses differences in shading, coloring, or the placing of symbols\nwithin predefined areas to indicate the average values of a property or quantity\nin those areas.\n\n<Row>\n<Column  colLg={12} colMd={8} colSm={4} >\n\n![Choropleth map](images/09_adv_geo_choropleth_928.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n### Proportional symbol map\n\nSymbols driven by data are overlayed in geographical regions. A bubble is the\nsymbol most commonly used in this instance—with the area of the circle\nproportional to its value in the dataset.\n\n<Row>\n<Column  colLg={12} colMd={8} colSm={4} >\n\n![Proportional symbol map](images/10_adv_geo_prop_sym_928.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n### Connection map\n\nConnection Maps are drawn by connecting points placed on a map by straight or\ncurved lines.\n\nWhile Connection Maps are great for showing connections and relationships\ngeographically, they can also be used to display map routes through a single\nchain of links. Connection Maps can also be useful in revealing spatial patterns\nthrough the distribution of connections or by how concentrated connections are\non a map.\n\n<Row>\n<Column  colLg={12} colMd={8} colSm={4} >\n\n![Connecting lines on a spatial map](images/11_adv_geo_connections_928.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n### Geospatial distortions\n\n#### Density-equalizing cartograms\n\nDensity-equalizing cartograms are the most common type of cartogram. In this\nsituation the mapping variable takes the place of the land area or distance in\nthe map, causing the map to become distorted in proportion to the substitute\nvariable.\n\nCartograms are useful for visualizing populations through different lenses — for\ninstance, ethnicities, political parties, or religious affiliation. Carbon does\nnot have a coded component for cartograms but online generators like\n[go-cart.io](https://go-cart.io/) allow you to upload your own data sets and\ndownload an .svg file.\n\n<Row>\n<Column  colLg={6} colMd={4} colSm={4} >\n\n![Equal area map](images/12a_adv_cartogram_448.png)\n\n</Column>\n\n<Column  colLg={6} colMd={4} colSm={4} >\n\n![Cartogram of population](images/12b_adv_cartogram_448.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n#### Dorling cartograms\n\nThe Dorling Cartogram is a technique for representing data for areas that avoids\ngeography in favor of (normally) a geometric shape that represents the unit\nareas. Circles are usually chosen since they can be neatly positioned.\n\nAs with the density-equalizing cartogram above, the larger the total population,\nthe larger the representation of the country.\n\n<Row>\n<Column  colLg={6} colMd={4} colSm={4} >\n\n![Dorling cartogram with squares](images/13_adv_geo_dorling_a_448.png)\n\n</Column>\n\n<Column  colLg={6} colMd={4} colSm={4} >\n\n![Dorling cartogram with circles](images/14_adv_geo_dorling_b_448.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n### Mapbox\n\nFor more dynamic, real-time mapping, Carbon has created four themes using\n[Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). Mapbox is a developer platform used across\nindustries to create custom maps that can be easily integrated into websites and\napps. These themes can be used as is, or in conjunction with Carbon-styled data\npoints.\n\nThese styles can be used as is, or as a backdrop for other geospatial data sets.\nFor more complex data sets that require the full breadth of the Carbon charts\npalette, we suggest using either the White or the Gray 100 style for the most\naccessible results.\n\n<Row>\n<Column  colLg={12} colMd={8} colSm={4} >\n\n![Mapbox white style](images/15_adv_geo_mapbox_a_928.png)\n\n<Caption>Example of a Carbon’s White theme style in Mapbox</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<Row>\n<Column  colLg={4} colMd={4} colSm={4} >\n\n![Mapbox g10 style](images/16_adv_geo_mapbox_b_288.png)\n\n<Caption>Example of a Carbon’s Gray 10 theme style in Mapbox</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n\n<Column  colLg={4} colMd={4} colSm={4} >\n\n![Mapbox g90 style](images/17_adv_geo_mapbox_c_288.png)\n\n<Caption>Example of a Carbon’s Gray 90 theme style in Mapbox</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n\n<Column  colLg={4} colMd={4} colSm={4} >\n\n![Mapbox g100 style](images/18_adv_geo_mapbox_d_288.png)\n\n<Caption>Example of a Carbon’s Gray 100 theme style in Mapbox</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n#### Applying the Carbon Mapbox themes\n\nFor instructions on how to use Mapbox GL JS please read this\n[Mapbox quickstart documentation](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/#quickstart).\n\nIn addition to the instructions above, when initializing a new map you can apply\nany of the 4 Carbon themes by providing the stylesheet location to the library.\n\n| Theme      | Style sheet location                                           |\n| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| _White_    | `mapbox://styles/carbondesignsystem/ck7c8cfpp08h61irrudv7f1xg` |\n| _Gray 10_  | `mapbox://styles/carbondesignsystem/ck7c8ce1y05h61ipb2fixfe76` |\n| _Gray 90_  | `mapbox://styles/carbondesignsystem/ck7c8ccac08jj1imhvd2g4qfb` |\n| _Gray 100_ | `mapbox://styles/carbondesignsystem/ck7c89g8708gy1imlz9g5o6h9` |\n\n<Title>Example</Title>\n\n```html\n<script>\n  mapboxgl.accessToken = 'YOUR_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN';\n  var map = new mapboxgl.Map({\n    // Applying the G100 theme below\n    style: 'mapbox://styles/carbondesignsystem/ck7c89g8708gy1imlz9g5o6h9',\n    // Include existing options below\n    // ...\n    // ...\n    // ...\n  });\n</script>\n```\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"e976f2eb0567f801fafd1a4db7f933f6","counter":4897,"owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Advanced charts","description":"Advanced charts are a powerful way to display complex data sets."},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Advanced charts\ndescription: Advanced charts are a powerful way to display complex data sets.\n---\n\n<PageDescription>\n\nAdvanced charts are a powerful way to display complex data sets.

For instance, even though one country may have a lot\nof visitors compared to another country, tourism for that country may fall below\nits annual average.\n\n<Row>\n<Column  colLg={12} colMd={8} colSm={4} >\n\n![Basic tree map](images/new_adv_treemap_02_928.png)\n\n<Caption>\n  Example of a divergent tree map adding color as a second variable to a basic\n  tree map structure\n</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<Row>\n<Column  colLg={4} colMd={4} colSm={4} >\n\n![Basic treemap tooltip detail](images/new_adv_treemap_a_288.png)\n\n<Caption>Detail of a tooltip on a basic treemap</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n\n<Column  colLg={4} colMd={4} colSm={4} >\n\n![Tooltip detail](images/new_adv_treemap_b_288.png)\n\n<Caption>Detail of a comparative tooltip on a divergent tree map</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n## Geospatial charts\n\n### Geographic overlays\n\n#### Choropleth map\n\nA map that uses differences in shading, coloring, or the placing of symbols\nwithin predefined areas to indicate the average values of a property or quantity\nin those areas.\n\n<Row>\n<Column  colLg={12} colMd={8} colSm={4} >\n\n![Choropleth map](images/09_adv_geo_choropleth_928.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n### Proportional symbol map\n\nSymbols driven by data are overlayed in geographical regions. A bubble is the\nsymbol most commonly used in this instance—with the area of the circle\nproportional to its value in the dataset.\n\n<Row>\n<Column  colLg={12} colMd={8} colSm={4} >\n\n![Proportional symbol map](images/10_adv_geo_prop_sym_928.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n### Connection map\n\nConnection Maps are drawn by connecting points placed on a map by straight or\ncurved lines.\n\nWhile Connection Maps are great for showing connections and relationships\ngeographically, they can also be used to display map routes through a single\nchain of links. Connection Maps can also be useful in revealing spatial patterns\nthrough the distribution of connections or by how concentrated connections are\non a map.\n\n<Row>\n<Column  colLg={12} colMd={8} colSm={4} >\n\n![Connecting lines on a spatial map](images/11_adv_geo_connections_928.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n### Geospatial distortions\n\n#### Density-equalizing cartograms\n\nDensity-equalizing cartograms are the most common type of cartogram. In this\nsituation the mapping variable takes the place of the land area or distance in\nthe map, causing the map to become distorted in proportion to the substitute\nvariable.\n\nCartograms are useful for visualizing populations through different lenses — for\ninstance, ethnicities, political parties, or religious affiliation. Carbon does\nnot have a coded component for cartograms but online generators like\n[go-cart.io](https://go-cart.io/) allow you to upload your own data sets and\ndownload an .svg file.\n\n<Row>\n<Column  colLg={6} colMd={4} colSm={4} >\n\n![Equal area map](images/12a_adv_cartogram_448.png)\n\n</Column>\n\n<Column  colLg={6} colMd={4} colSm={4} >\n\n![Cartogram of population](images/12b_adv_cartogram_448.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n#### Dorling cartograms\n\nThe Dorling Cartogram is a technique for representing data for areas that avoids\ngeography in favor of (normally) a geometric shape that represents the unit\nareas. Circles are usually chosen since they can be neatly positioned.\n\nAs with the density-equalizing cartogram above, the larger the total population,\nthe larger the representation of the country.\n\n<Row>\n<Column  colLg={6} colMd={4} colSm={4} >\n\n![Dorling cartogram with squares](images/13_adv_geo_dorling_a_448.png)\n\n</Column>\n\n<Column  colLg={6} colMd={4} colSm={4} >\n\n![Dorling cartogram with circles](images/14_adv_geo_dorling_b_448.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n### Mapbox\n\nFor more dynamic, real-time mapping, Carbon has created four themes using\n[Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). Mapbox is a developer platform used across\nindustries to create custom maps that can be easily integrated into websites and\napps. These themes can be used as is, or in conjunction with Carbon-styled data\npoints.\n\nThese styles can be used as is, or as a backdrop for other geospatial data sets.\nFor more complex data sets that require the full breadth of the Carbon charts\npalette, we suggest using either the White or the Gray 100 style for the most\naccessible results.\n\n<Row>\n<Column  colLg={12} colMd={8} colSm={4} >\n\n![Mapbox white style](images/15_adv_geo_mapbox_a_928.png)\n\n<Caption>Example of a Carbon’s White theme style in Mapbox</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<Row>\n<Column  colLg={4} colMd={4} colSm={4} >\n\n![Mapbox g10 style](images/16_adv_geo_mapbox_b_288.png)\n\n<Caption>Example of a Carbon’s Gray 10 theme style in Mapbox</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n\n<Column  colLg={4} colMd={4} colSm={4} >\n\n![Mapbox g90 style](images/17_adv_geo_mapbox_c_288.png)\n\n<Caption>Example of a Carbon’s Gray 90 theme style in Mapbox</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n\n<Column  colLg={4} colMd={4} colSm={4} >\n\n![Mapbox g100 style](images/18_adv_geo_mapbox_d_288.png)\n\n<Caption>Example of a Carbon’s Gray 100 theme style in Mapbox</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n#### Applying the Carbon Mapbox themes\n\nFor instructions on how to use Mapbox GL JS please read this\n[Mapbox quickstart documentation](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/#quickstart).\n\nIn addition to the instructions above, when initializing a new map you can apply\nany of the 4 Carbon themes by providing the stylesheet location to the library.\n\n| Theme      | Style sheet location                                           |\n| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| _White_    | `mapbox://styles/carbondesignsystem/ck7c8cfpp08h61irrudv7f1xg` |\n| _Gray 10_  | `mapbox://styles/carbondesignsystem/ck7c8ce1y05h61ipb2fixfe76` |\n| _Gray 90_  | `mapbox://styles/carbondesignsystem/ck7c8ccac08jj1imhvd2g4qfb` |\n| _Gray 100_ | `mapbox://styles/carbondesignsystem/ck7c89g8708gy1imlz9g5o6h9` |\n\n<Title>Example</Title>\n\n```html\n<script>\n  mapboxgl.accessToken = 'YOUR_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN';\n  var map = new mapboxgl.Map({\n    // Applying the G100 theme below\n    style: 'mapbox://styles/carbondesignsystem/ck7c89g8708gy1imlz9g5o6h9',\n    // Include existing options below\n    // ...\n    // ...\n    // ...\n  });\n</script>\n```\n","fileAbsolutePath":"/Users/jvernon/Documents/Design System/carbon/carbon-website/src/pages/data-visualization/advanced-charts/index.mdx"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1364590287","2102389209","2102389209","2368708353","2456312558","2746626797","2746626797","3018647132","3018647132","3037994772","3037994772","63531786","63531786","711213475","768070550"]}
