It is not read by a screen reader and takes on the default disabled visual style.                                                                                                               |\n| _Read-only_        | The user cannot interact with it but content is still readable and accessible to a screen reader. The visual style should contain no interactive indicators such as `$interactive-01`, hover states, or text embellishments (i.e., underlines). |\n| _Hidden_           | The component is completely hidden from view. The user does not know the option is there.                                                                                                                                                       |\n\n## Default disabled\n\nA default disabled state is used when a component is temporarily disabled due to\ndependencies (when one piece of software relies on another one) or\npre-requisites. This scenario is a temporary state change that is most commonly\ntriggered by a user’s action or inaction. Once the dependencies have been\nresolved and/or the pre-requisites have been fulfilled, the default disabled\ncomponent returns to its enabled state. In a temporarily disabled scenario the\ncomponent should never fully disappear from the user’s view.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Default disabled example on the right](images/disabled-1.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n### Style\n\nDefault disabled states are most commonly styled by a decrease in opacity with\nno hover state change and `not-allowed` cursor applied. Refer to each individual\ncomponent for the accurate disabled state.\n\n| Attribute   | Default disabled style |\n| ----------- | ---------------------- |\n| _Component_ | 50% opacity            |\n| _Text_      | 25% opacity            |\n| _Icons_     | 50% opacity            |\n| _Hover_     | None                   |\n| _Cursor_    | `not-allowed`          |\n\n<br />\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Default disabled style examples](images/disabled-2.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n### Additional warning\n\nAn [inline warning notification](/components/notification/usage) can be shown in\ncases where a temporarily disabled item affects multiple items or the primary\naction of the flow. The notification should describe how the user can enable or\nre-enable the disabled component.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Additional warning with default disabled example](images/disabled-3.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n## Read-only\n\nIn scenarios where the content of a disabled component or element is still\nrelevant to the user or important to task completion, then the read-only\nvariation is used. This allows the user to read the information but not interact\nwith or change it. Read-only content should always be accessible to a screen\nreader.\n\n### Style\n\nThe visual style of the read-only states vary by component but should never\ncontain any interactive indicators such as `$brand-01` color usage, hover\nstates, or text embellishments (i.e., underlines).\n\n## Hidden\n\nThe hidden disabled variation is used when something or someone does not have\npermission to view, interact with, or take action on an element of the UI. This\nvariation completely hides the component, page, action, etc. from the user’s\ninterface. The only way to enable the hidden element and have it resurfaced on\nthe UI is to change the assigned permission.\n\nFor example, when a user is the organization owner they are allowed to add\nmembers to the organization. Any users that are not an organization owner would\nnot be shown the “Add member” button on a team directory page. Once the user is\nmade an organization owner, **then and only then** will the button be visible.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Example of hidden disabled content on the right](images/disabled-4.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"70b8ad8c2e88b71bfb095eb19874a6af","counter":2989,"owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Disabled states","description":"A disabled state is applied to a component when the user is not allowed to interact with the component due to either permissions, dependencies, or pre-requisites."},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Disabled states\ndescription:\n  A disabled state is applied to a component when the user is not allowed to\n  interact with the component due to either permissions, dependencies, or\n  pre-requisites.\n---\n\n<PageDescription>\n\nA disabled state is applied to a component when the user is not allowed to\ninteract with the component due to either permissions, dependencies, or\npre-requisites.
