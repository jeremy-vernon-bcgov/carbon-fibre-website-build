Truncated items are represented by an\nellipsis `...` and should represent three or more truncated characters in a text\nstring. There must be at least four characters of non-truncated content in a\ntruncated string. Truncated items always include a browser tooltip on hover to\nshow the entire string, name, or phrase that the ellipsis is representing. The\nonly time a browser tooltip does not need to be used is at the end of a\ntruncated paragraph.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Example of a browser tooltip being used for truncation.](images/BrowserTooltip.png)\n\n<Caption>Example of a browser tooltip being used for truncation.</Caption>\n\n![Example of end-line truncation for a paragraph.](images/Truncated-Paragraph.png)\n\n<Caption>Example of end-line truncation for a paragraph.</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n### Usage\n\nGood use cases for truncation include:\n\n- Breadcrumbs\n- Pagination\n- Long URL links\n- Paragraph of text (i.e. a description paragraph)\n- Shortening of a long item name (user- or platform-generated)\n\nTruncation should **not** be used on page headers, titles, labels, error\nmessages, validation messages, or notifications.\n\n### Variations\n\nThere are three types of truncation: front-line, mid-line, and end-line.\n\n| Type         | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |     | Default                       | Truncated                   |\n| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------- |\n| _Front-line_ | Used at the beginning of a text string to indicate the text is continued from a previous location.                                                                                                                             |     | `123456789`                   | `...56789`                  |\n| _Mid-line_   | Used when several text strings have different beginnings and/or endings but the exact same middle characters.
