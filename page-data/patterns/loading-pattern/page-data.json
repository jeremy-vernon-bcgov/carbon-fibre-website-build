According to\n[research](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/progress-indicators/) conducted by\nthe Nielsen Norman Group, skeleton states and other loading indicators improve\nuser satisfaction.\n\nIn this pattern, we will look at skeleton states, loading indicators, and\nprogressive loading.\n\n## Skeleton states\n\nSkeleton states are simplified versions of components used on an initial page\nload to indicate that the information on the page has not fully loaded yet. They\nshould only appear for only a few seconds, disappearing once components and\ncontent populate the page.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Example of a text skeleton state in a data table](images/skeleton.png)\n\n<Caption>Example of a skeleton state</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\nSkeleton states use motion to convey that the page is not stuck and that data is\nstill being loaded. This can help to\n[reduce user uncertainty](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/progress-indicators/).\n\nOnly use skeleton states on container-based components like tiles and structured\nlists or data-based components like data tables and cards. In most cases, action\ncomponents (e.g. buttons, input fields, checkboxes, toggles) do not need to have\na skeleton state.\n\nNever represent toast notifications, overflow menus, dropdown items, modals, and\nloaders with skeleton states. Elements inside a modal may have a skeleton state,\nbut the modal itself should not.\n\n## Loading indicators\n\nLoading indicators signal a user action is processing. Unlike progress bars,\nloading indicators only signal that loading is occurring and do not give any\nindication of progress. If a process will take more than a moment or two to\ncomplete, use a progress indicator instead.\n\nFull-screen loading indicators tell a user the entire application is processing,\nwhile inline indicators show that a specific selection or action is processing.\n\n### Full-screen loading\n\nThe [loading component](/components/loading/usage) should be used when the\nentire page is processing. This is often applied after data is submitted or\nsaved by the user.\n\nIf the process is going to take more than a few minutes, consider including a\n[notification](/patterns/notification-pattern).\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Example of a progress indicator in an application](/images/larger-loader.png)\n\n<Caption>Example of a progress indicator in an application</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n| When to use                                        |                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| _An action temporarily disables the application_   | If a user’s action temporarily disables the application while processing occurs, use a loading indicator and a full-screen overlay.                                          |\n| _Processing takes more than a few seconds_         | If a loading process will require the application’s full resources and will take longer than a moment or two, use a full-screen loading indicator.                           |\n| _Data from user input is being saved or submitted_ | Saving data following with user input often takes a few moments. Using a loading indicator allows the application to finish processing before allowing the user to continue. |\n\n### Inline loading\n\nUse the inline loading component when a single component is processing. For\nexample, when an administrator invites a user, an inline loading component\nindicates the system is processing the invite request.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Example of an inline loading indicator](/images/inline-loading-animated.gif)\n\n<Caption>Example of an inline loading indicator</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n## Progressive loading\n\nProgressive loading is a technique that loads pages in batches. The simplest\nview of the page loads first, followed by progressively more detailed batches\nuntil the entire viewport has loaded.\n\nThe primary batch should show a page’s basic structure (the skeleton state\nversions of the container-based components), data-based text (the skeleton state\nversion of text) and non-data text. Following batches can include images,\ncontent outside of the viewport, interactive (action-based) components, and\ndata-based text.\n\nNot all items need a skeleton state and instead can be expressed as negative or\nwhite space until they load. For example, a 600 x 600px image can be shown as a\n600 x 600px area of white space until the full image loads.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={4}>\n\n![First phase of a dashboard using skeleton states to demonstrate progressive loading](/images/prog-loading-1.png)\n\n<Caption>Phases of progressive loading</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n<Column colLg={4}>\n\n![Second phase of a dashboard using skeleton states to demonstrate progressive loading](/images/prog-loading-2.png)\n\n</Column>\n<Column colLg={4}>\n\n![Third phase of a dashboard using skeleton states to demonstrate progressive loading](/images/prog-loading-3.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<br />\n\n| When to use                                        |                                                                                                   |\n| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| _A page view is slow to load_                      | Pages that source data from multiple sources, such as dashboards, and can be slow to load.        |\n| _A user changes filters or facets in a table view_ | Tables may be sourcing information from large data sets and so processing may take a few moments. |\n\n## Load more options\n\nA Load more option can be used to extend a list where only a small fraction of\noptions are displayed.
