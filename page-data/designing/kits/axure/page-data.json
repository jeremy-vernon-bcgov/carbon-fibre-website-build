Install Axure RP.\n\nTo design with the Carbon Axure Kit you must have the latest version of\n[Axure RP](https://www.axure.com/download) installed.\n\n#### 2. Get the widget library.\n\nThe library contains the widgets for Carbon components, design elements, and\nother common shapes.\n\nDownload the `.rplib` file to your computer. Open Axure and click the Add\nLibrary `+` icon at the top of the Libraries pane. Locate and select the\n`IBM Carbon 10.rplib` file.\n\n<Row className=\"resource-card-group\">\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4} noGutterSm>\n  <ResourceCard\n    subTitle=\"Get the Axure widget library\"\n    href=\"https://github.com/IBM/design-kit/blob/master/Axure/IBM%20Carbon%2010.rplib?raw=true\"\n    actionIcon=\"download\">\n\n![](/images/axure-icon.png)\n\n  </ResourceCard>\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<br />\n\n#### 3. Download the template.\n\nThis Axure file has the settings that are required for the proper display of\nelements.\n\n<Row className=\"resource-card-group\">\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4} noGutterSm>\n  <ResourceCard\n    subTitle=\"Get the Axure template\"\n    href=\"https://github.com/IBM/design-kit/blob/master/Axure/ibm-carbon-template.rp?raw=true\"\n    actionIcon=\"download\">\n\n![](/images/axure-icon.png)\n\n  </ResourceCard>\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<br />\n\n## Start designing\n\nTo get started, familiarize yourself with the contents of the template and\nwidget library.\n\n### Start with the template\n\nCreate a new project document with the template by opening\n`ibm-carbon-template.rp` and saving a copy.\n\nIn the template, IBM Plex Sans and IBM Plex Mono are included as web fonts in\nthe Generate HTML settings and will be displayed properly on any computer, even\nwithout these fonts being installed locally.\n\nThe Default, Paragraph, and Text Link styles are pre-configured, which allows\ntext to be pasted from the clipboard or text link inserted in a paragraph to\nmatch the typography and color guidelines by default.\n\n### Using widgets\n\nUse the widgets from the IBM Carbon 10 Axure library installed in step two to\nstart designing. You’ll find the widgets located in the Libraries pane in the\nleft side panel. To add a widget to the canvas, click and drag it from the\nLibraries pane.\n\nAll widgets come with styles and interactions already built into them. To edit\nthe widgets, follow the guide in the\n[Carbon Axure Kit documentation](https://ibm.github.io/design-kit/axure/) that\nwill help you to maintain the designed behavior of the elements.\n\n## Support\n\nIf you are brand new to Axure, they\noffer [tutorials](https://docs.axure.com/tutorials/basics/getting-started/) to\nget you started.\n\n### Releases\n\nWe make small adjustments and bug fixes to the kit on a regular basis. When a\nnew version of the library is available, you need to download the new file to\nreplace the old one. Releases will be posted to the\n[GitHub repo](https://github.com/IBM/design-kit).\n\nIf you're an IBMer, join the #carbon-axure-kit Slack channel to get notified\nabout changes.\n\n### Updating existing documents\n\nIn an Axure RP document, styles already in use in the document prevail when\nadding widgets from a library. The existing style in the document will be\napplied to a library widget when the widget is dragged onto the document canvas.\n\nReplacing the library won’t update the widget styles in your existing project\nfiles automatically. Follow the manual process below to update the styles.\n\nImport the styles from the library file into project documents using the Import\nWizard.\n\n1. Open your project in Axure RP.\n2. Go to `File` → `Import from RP file...` and select the .rplib library file.\n3. In the wizard, go to the Import Widget Styles step, and select all custom\n   styles. \"Default\" should **not** be selected.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Axure wizard settings](images/axure-updates.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n4. Skip to the end of the wizard and click Finish to import the styles.\n\n### Help\n\nCan’t find an answer to your question?
