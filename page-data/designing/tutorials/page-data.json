This video covers how the IBM Design\nLanguage is applied to Carbon, how Carbon interacts with domain level guidance,\nand what it means to be an open source design system.\n\n<Video vimeoId=\"457802924\" />\n\nFor further learning, check out\n[All about Carbon](/all-about-carbon/what-is-carbon),\n[Get started](/designing/get-started), and the\n[IBM Design Language](https://www.ibm.com/design/language/).\n\n## Designing with Carbon\n\nThis video covers how to design with components and type styles, and where to\nfind relevant guidance and resources while designing. It also goes through the\nsteps of getting set up with the Carbon Sketch kits and grid template.\n\n<Video vimeoId=\"457803206\" />\n\nTo learn more about our Sketch kits, head over to\n[Design kits](/designing/kits/sketch).\n\n## Using the 2x Grid\n\nLearn about the fundamentals of using our 2x Grid. This video gives an overview\nof basic grid terminology, breakpoints, the three grid modes, and some resources\nto get started designing with the 2x Grid.\n\n<Video vimeoId=\"457802917\" />\n\nYou can find detailed grid guidance on the\n[2x Grid](/guidelines/2x-grid/overview) page.\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"af541f17309d4d62f29b4a4fb9851a1a","counter":3057,"owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Tutorials","description":"The Carbon design tutorials will get you set up to start designing with Carbon and teach you about some of the foundational pieces of the design system."},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Tutorials\ndescription:\n  The Carbon design tutorials will get you set up to start designing with Carbon\n  and teach you about some of the foundational pieces of the design system.\n---\n\nimport { Button } from 'carbon-components-react';\nimport { ArrowRight16 } from '@carbon/icons-react';\n\n<PageDescription>\n\nThe Carbon design tutorials will get you set up to start designing with Carbon\nand teach you about some of the foundational pieces of the design system.\n\n</PageDescription>\n\n<AnchorLinks>\n\n<AnchorLink>Introduction to Carbon</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Designing with Carbon</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Using the 2x Grid</AnchorLink>\n\n</AnchorLinks>\n\n## Introduction to Carbon\n\nLearn about Carbon and its history.
